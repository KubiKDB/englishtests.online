  "passage": "<br>(1) Karl Marx, the German philosopher, economist, and revolutionary, developed ideas in the mid-19th century that profoundly transformed political thought and inspired movements that would reshape the global landscape. Born into a middle-class family in 1818, Marx witnessed the social upheavals of early industrial capitalism and devoted his intellectual life to analyzing its contradictions. His collaboration with Friedrich Engels led to seminal works including \"The Communist Manifesto\" and \"Das Kapital,\" which articulated his critique of capitalism and vision of historical materialism—a framework arguing that economic systems fundamentally determine social structures and drive historical development.<br><br>(2) Central to Marx's analysis was the concept of class struggle. He maintained that history progresses through conflicts between oppressor and oppressed classes, with capitalism creating an inherent tension between bourgeoisie (owners of production means) and proletariat (workers). Marx theorized that capitalism contained internal contradictions that would ultimately lead to its collapse; specifically, he argued that the relentless pursuit of profit would generate increasingly severe economic crises, while simultaneously creating a unified working class capable of revolutionary action. This historical process would culminate, he predicted, in the workers seizing control of production and establishing a socialist system that would eventually evolve into communism—a classless society where resources are distributed according to need.<br><br>(3) Marx's ideas gained traction in various forms across different societies. The Russian Revolution of 1917 represented the first major attempt to implement Marxist principles, though the resulting Soviet system diverged significantly from Marx's vision of worker-controlled production. Throughout the 20th century, numerous states embraced variations of Marxist ideology, adapting his theoretical framework to their specific historical and cultural contexts. These adaptations ranged from the state-controlled economy of the Soviet Union to China's current hybrid of centralized political control and market economics—implementations that Marx himself might have struggled to recognize as extensions of his thought.<br><br>(4) Despite the collapse of many self-proclaimed Marxist states, Marx's analytical methods continue to influence contemporary social theory. His emphasis on examining the economic underpinnings of social relationships remains fundamental to disciplines ranging from sociology to literary criticism. Critical theorists have expanded Marxist analysis beyond class to examine other forms of structural inequality involving gender, race, and postcolonial relationships. Additionally, his concept of alienation—the disconnection workers experience from their labor under capitalism—resonates with modern discussions about meaningful work in automated economies.<br><br>(5) In recent decades, Marx's critique of capitalism has experienced renewed interest, particularly following the 2008 global financial crisis. His analysis of capitalism's tendency toward concentration of wealth, cyclical crises, and commodification of social relationships has struck many observers as prescient in light of growing economic inequality and financial instability. While few contemporary economists or political theorists advocate for the revolutionary overthrow of capitalism as Marx envisioned, his insights into the tensions between capital accumulation and social welfare continue to inform debates about economic justice, globalization, and sustainable development. This enduring relevance suggests that Marx's legacy lies less in providing a blueprint for society than in offering analytical tools for understanding systemic contradictions in economic and social arrangements.",
