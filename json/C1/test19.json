  "passage": "<br>(1) Environmental sustainability has emerged as a paramount concern for economists and policymakers alike in recent decades. The traditional view that economic growth and environmental protection are mutually exclusive objectives has gradually given way to a more nuanced understanding of their interdependence. Contemporary economic theories increasingly recognize that long-term prosperity hinges on the preservation of natural capital—the stock of natural resources that provides valuable goods and services to humanity—as depletion of these resources can impose significant costs on future generations.<br><br>(2) Market-based instruments have proven particularly effective in addressing environmental externalities without unduly hampering economic development. Carbon taxes and emissions trading systems, for instance, incorporate the social cost of carbon into market prices, thereby incentivizing businesses and consumers to reduce their carbon footprint. These mechanisms allow for environmental objectives to be met at the lowest possible cost to society by leveraging the efficiency of market forces rather than relying solely on command-and-control regulations.<br><br>(3) The transition toward a green economy also presents substantial opportunities for innovation and job creation. Investments in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and circular economy initiatives have the potential to stimulate economic growth while simultaneously reducing environmental degradation. Studies have shown that green industries often generate more employment per unit of investment than traditional carbon-intensive sectors, challenging the assumption that environmental policies necessarily result in job losses or reduced competitiveness.<br><br>(4) Nevertheless, the path toward environmental sustainability is fraught with challenges from an economic perspective. Developing countries, in particular, face the daunting task of raising living standards while minimizing ecological damage—a balancing act that industrialized nations did not have to perform during their own development. International cooperation and financial mechanisms are therefore essential to ensure an equitable distribution of the costs and benefits associated with global environmental action.<br><br>(5) Ultimately, the economic case for environmental sustainability rests on the recognition that our economic system is embedded within, and dependent upon, the natural environment. The depletion of natural resources, loss of biodiversity, and climate change pose systemic risks to economic stability that far outweigh the short-term costs of transitioning to more sustainable practices. Forward-thinking economists now advocate for a fundamental shift in how we measure economic success, moving beyond GDP to incorporate indicators that reflect the health of both human and natural systems.",
