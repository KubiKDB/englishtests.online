  "passage": "<br>(1) International trade has become an increasingly significant driver of global economic growth, offering both opportunities and challenges for developing countries seeking to integrate into the world economy. The expansion of international trade networks has created pathways for these nations to access larger markets, attract foreign investment, and accelerate technological advancement. However, the benefits of trade liberalization are not automatically distributed equitably, and developing countries often face structural disadvantages when competing with more established economies.<br><br>(2) One of the primary advantages of international trade for developing countries is access to global markets, which enables them to specialize in products where they possess comparative advantages. This specialization allows these nations to achieve economies of scale and generate export earnings that can be invested in economic development. Additionally, integration into global value chains presents opportunities for technology transfer and knowledge spillovers that can enhance domestic productivity and industrial capabilities. Foreign direct investment, often facilitated by trade agreements, can provide much-needed capital for infrastructure development and job creation.<br><br>(3) Despite these potential benefits, developing countries frequently encounter substantial challenges in the international trading system. Many face difficulties accessing markets in developed countries due to tariff escalation, non-tariff barriers, and stringent product standards that can function as de facto protectionist measures. Furthermore, volatile commodity prices can create economic instability for countries heavily dependent on primary exports. The uneven playing field is often exacerbated by agricultural subsidies in wealthy nations, which undermine the competitiveness of farmers in developing countries who lack similar government support.<br><br>(4) Trade liberalization also carries risks of premature deindustrialization for developing economies. Opening markets too rapidly without adequate institutional frameworks and adjustment mechanisms may lead to the displacement of domestic industries unable to compete with foreign imports. This concern is particularly acute for infant industries that require temporary protection to develop competitive capabilities. Additionally, the increasing emphasis on intellectual property rights in trade agreements may restrict access to essential technologies and medicines, potentially hampering development objectives.<br><br>(5) To maximize the benefits while mitigating the risks of international trade, developing countries must pursue strategic approaches to trade policy. This includes sequencing liberalization efforts, investing in human capital and infrastructure, diversifying export portfolios, and strengthening domestic institutions. Regional trade agreements among developing countries can create larger markets while allowing for more gradual integration into the global economy. Ultimately, the relationship between international trade and development is complex, requiring tailored policies that account for each country's unique economic structure, development stage, and social objectives.",
