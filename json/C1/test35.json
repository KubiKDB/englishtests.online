  "passage": "<br>(1) Social stratification, the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes within a society, continues to play a significant role in determining educational outcomes across the globe. In most societies, access to quality education varies substantially based on socioeconomic status, with those born into affluent families typically enjoying superior educational resources and opportunities. This disparity begins at an early age and often becomes more pronounced as students progress through the educational system, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that is challenging to break.<br><br>(2) Research consistently demonstrates that children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds face numerous obstacles in their educational journey. These impediments include under-resourced schools, less qualified teachers, inadequate learning materials, and environments less conducive to academic achievement. Additionally, these students frequently lack access to enrichment activities, tutoring services, and the cultural capital that their more privileged counterparts take for granted. The cumulative effect of these disadvantages manifests in lower test scores, higher dropout rates, and diminished prospects for higher education.<br><br>(3) Conversely, students from affluent backgrounds benefit from well-funded schools, experienced educators, and supportive learning environments. Their families can afford supplementary educational resources, extracurricular activities, and private tutoring when necessary. Moreover, these students often inherit valuable social networks and cultural knowledge that facilitate navigation through educational institutions and subsequent entry into prestigious universities and lucrative career paths. This phenomenon illustrates how educational systems, ostensibly designed to provide equal opportunities, can instead reinforce existing social hierarchies.<br><br>(4) Various policy interventions have been implemented to mitigate these disparities, with varying degrees of success. Approaches include school funding reforms, early childhood education programs, affirmative action policies, and targeted support for disadvantaged students. Some nations have achieved notable progress through comprehensive reforms that address multiple aspects of inequality simultaneously. However, truly equalizing educational opportunities requires addressing broader societal inequalities in income, healthcare, housing, and employment—a complex undertaking that extends beyond educational policy alone.<br><br>(5) The relationship between social stratification and educational opportunity remains one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary societies. As knowledge economies increasingly demand higher levels of education for economic success, addressing these inequalities becomes not only a matter of social justice but also an economic imperative. Creating genuinely meritocratic educational systems—where achievement depends primarily on ability and effort rather than family background—represents an essential step toward building more equitable and productive societies.",
