  "passage": "<br>(1) Supply and demand constitute the fundamental forces driving price formation in market economies. When consumers' desire for a product (demand) interacts with producers' willingness to provide it (supply), a market price emerges that theoretically satisfies both parties. This price discovery mechanism operates continuously across countless markets, from basic commodities to sophisticated financial instruments, serving as the invisible hand that allocates resources efficiently without central coordination.<br><br>(2) Demand is primarily influenced by several key factors: consumer preferences, income levels, prices of related goods, and expectations about future conditions. As consumers' purchasing power increases, demand typically rises, creating upward pressure on prices. Conversely, when substitute products become less expensive, demand for the original product may decline. These relationships are quantified through concepts like price elasticity, which measures how responsive demand is to price changes—essential knowledge for businesses making strategic pricing decisions.<br><br>(3) Supply, in contrast, responds to production costs, technology, resource availability, and producer expectations. Firms seek profit maximization, increasing production when marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost. Technological advancements that reduce production costs can shift the supply curve rightward, potentially lowering market prices while increasing quantity. Similarly, adverse events affecting resource availability—such as natural disasters or regulatory changes—can constrain supply, driving prices upward if demand remains constant.<br><br>(4) Market equilibrium occurs when supply and demand forces balance, establishing a price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. This equilibrium is dynamic rather than static; any exogenous shock disrupting either supply or demand triggers price adjustments until a new equilibrium emerges. For instance, a sudden surge in consumer interest creates excess demand at the current price, incentivizing suppliers to raise prices and increase production. These adjustments continue until the market clears again—a self-correcting process that economists consider remarkably efficient despite its decentralized nature.<br><br>(5) Nevertheless, real-world markets frequently deviate from theoretical models due to imperfect information, external costs or benefits, market power, and various frictions. Price controls, whether ceilings or floors, can prevent markets from reaching equilibrium, leading to shortages or surpluses. Similarly, monopolistic conditions can result in prices higher than those that would prevail under perfect competition. Understanding these complexities helps policymakers design appropriate interventions when market failures occur while preserving the essential price formation mechanism that underpins modern economies.",
