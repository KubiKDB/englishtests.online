  "passage": "<br>(1) Art classes are very important in schools today. They help students learn how to express themselves in different ways. When children draw, paint, or make things with their hands, they develop important skills. Art gives students a chance to be creative and use their imagination.<br><br>(2) Many studies show that art education improves other school subjects too. Students who take art classes often do better in math, reading, and science. This is because art teaches children how to solve problems and think in new ways. Art activities also help students learn to focus and pay attention to details.<br><br>(3) Art classes are also good for emotional development. Creating art helps students understand and express their feelings. In art class, there are no wrong answers, which helps build confidence. Students learn that it is okay to make mistakes and try again. They also learn how to give and receive feedback about their work.<br><br>(4) Finally, art education teaches important life skills. Students learn how to work together on group projects. They practice how to plan and finish tasks. Art classes also help students understand different cultures and traditions through studying artists from around the world. These skills are useful for many jobs and situations in adult life.",
