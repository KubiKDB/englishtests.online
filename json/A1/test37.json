  "passage": "<br>(1) There are four seasons in a year: spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Each season is different and brings changes to our world. The seasons change because the Earth moves around the sun. When one part of the Earth is closer to the sun, it is warmer there.<br><br>(2) Spring is when plants start to grow and flowers bloom. The weather gets warmer, and days become longer. Many baby animals are born in spring. People often like to spend more time outside as the weather improves.<br><br>(3) Summer is the hottest season. The days are very long, and the sun is strong. Many people go on vacation during summer. Children don't go to school, and families often visit beaches or parks. In summer, we eat ice cream and drink cold drinks to stay cool.<br><br>(4) Autumn (or fall) is when leaves change color and fall from trees. The weather gets cooler, and days become shorter. Many fruits and vegetables are ready to eat in autumn. Winter is the coldest season. In some places, it snows in winter. Days are short, and nights are long. People wear warm clothes and often celebrate holidays like Christmas in winter.",
