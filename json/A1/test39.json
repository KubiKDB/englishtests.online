  "passage": "<br>(1) Fish live in water, but they need oxygen to survive just like animals on land. Instead of using lungs to breathe, most fish have special organs called gills. These gills are located on both sides of a fish's head. When a fish opens its mouth, water flows in and then passes through the gills.<br><br>(2) Inside the gills, there are many thin layers of tissue with tiny blood vessels. As water passes through these thin layers, oxygen from the water moves into the blood vessels. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from the blood into the water. This exchange of gases is called respiration.<br><br>(3) Fish have a special way to make this process work well. They continuously open and close their mouths to keep fresh water flowing over their gills. Some fish, like sharks, must swim all the time to push water through their gills. Other fish can pump water through their gills even when they are not moving.<br><br>(4) There are some unusual fish that can breathe in different ways. Lungfish have both gills and simple lungs. They can breathe underwater and can also breathe air when water dries up. Some fish like the climbing perch can absorb oxygen through their skin. These special adaptations help fish survive in different water environments.",
