  "passage": "<br>(1) Cats and dogs are both popular pets around the world. They are animals that many people love to have in their homes. Cats are often quiet and like to sleep a lot during the day. Dogs, on the other hand, are usually more active and need more exercise.<br><br>(2) There are many differences in how cats and dogs look. Cats are typically smaller than dogs, with soft fur and sharp claws. Most cats have long tails that help them balance when they jump or climb. Dogs come in many different sizes, from very small to very large. They have different types of fur, and their tails can be long or short.<br><br>(3) Cats and dogs also eat different foods. Cats need to eat meat because they are carnivores. Dogs can eat both meat and plants because they are omnivores. Both animals need fresh water every day to stay healthy. It is important to give cats and dogs the right food for their needs.<br><br>(4) Another difference is how cats and dogs behave with people. Cats are often more independent and may spend time alone. Dogs usually like to be with people more and can learn many commands. Both cats and dogs can be wonderful pets if you take good care of them and give them love.",
