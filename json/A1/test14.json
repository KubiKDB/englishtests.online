  "passage": "<br>(1) Ants are small insects that live together in groups called colonies. In an ant colony, every ant has a special job to do. Some ants look for food, some build the nest, and others take care of the baby ants. They all work together to help their colony live and grow.<br><br>(2) The queen ant is the most important ant in the colony. Her job is to lay eggs. Worker ants are female ants that cannot have babies. They do many jobs like finding food, building the nest, and protecting the colony from danger. Male ants have only one job - to mate with new queens.<br><br>(3) Ants use special chemicals called pheromones to talk to each other. When an ant finds food, it leaves a trail of these chemicals on the ground. Other ants can smell this trail and follow it to the food. Ants also use touches and movements to share information with other ants in their colony.<br><br>(4) Ants are very strong for their size. One ant can carry things that are 20 times heavier than its own body. When ants need to move something very heavy, they work together. Many ants will push and pull at the same time. This teamwork helps ants do big jobs even though they are very small animals.",
