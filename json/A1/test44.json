  "passage": "<br>(1) Plants have been used for medicine for thousands of years. People in many countries know which plants can help when someone is sick. They learn this knowledge from their parents and grandparents. Today, many doctors also use plants to make medicine.<br><br>(2) Some plants can help with simple problems. For example, tea made from chamomile flowers can help people sleep better. Mint leaves can help with stomach pain. Aloe vera is a plant that helps heal small cuts and burns when you put it on your skin.<br><br>(3) In some places, people collect plants from forests or mountains. They dry the leaves, flowers, or roots to use later. In other places, people grow medicinal plants in their gardens. This way, they always have the plants when they need them. Some families have special recipes for making medicine from plants.<br><br>(4) Modern scientists now study these plants to understand why they work. They find the helpful parts of the plants and use them to make new medicines. About 25% of all medicines today come from plants. Even though we have many new medicines now, plants are still very important for health around the world.",
