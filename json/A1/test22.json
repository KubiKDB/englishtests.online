  "passage": "<br>(1) The Great Wall of China is one of the most famous buildings in the world. It is a very long wall that was built to protect China from its enemies. The wall is over 21,000 kilometers long and runs from east to west across northern China. Many parts of the wall are on mountains, which made it harder for enemies to attack.<br><br>(2) The Great Wall was not built all at once. The first parts were built more than 2,000 years ago, during the Qin Dynasty. Later, other rulers added more sections to the wall. Most of the wall that we can see today was built during the Ming Dynasty, about 600 years ago. The wall was made of stone, brick, wood, and earth.<br><br>(3) Today, the Great Wall is in different conditions in different places. Some parts are in very good condition, especially near Beijing, where many tourists visit. Other parts of the wall have been damaged by weather and time, and some sections have disappeared completely. The best time to visit the Great Wall is in spring or autumn when the weather is not too hot or cold.<br><br>(4) The Great Wall of China is important for many reasons. It shows how skilled the ancient Chinese were at building things. It also helps us understand Chinese history and culture. In 1987, the Great Wall became a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This means it is protected because it is so important to people all over the world.",
