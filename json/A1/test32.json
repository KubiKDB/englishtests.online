  "passage": "<br>(1) Fruits and vegetables are both healthy foods that come from plants. Fruits grow from the flower of a plant and have seeds inside. Vegetables come from other parts of the plant, like the leaves, stems, or roots. Many people think tomatoes are vegetables, but they are actually fruits because they have seeds and grow from flowers.<br><br>(2) Fruits are usually sweet or sour. Apples, bananas, oranges, and strawberries are common fruits. Most people eat fruits raw as a snack or in desserts. Fruits contain natural sugar called fructose, which gives them their sweet taste. They are also full of vitamins, especially vitamin C.<br><br>(3) Vegetables, on the other hand, often taste less sweet. Carrots, potatoes, onions, and lettuce are examples of vegetables. People cook many vegetables before eating them. Vegetables have fewer calories than fruits but are rich in different vitamins and minerals. They are important for a balanced diet.<br><br>(4) In cooking, fruits and vegetables are used differently. Chefs use fruits in sweet dishes like pies, cakes, and jams. Vegetables are common in savory dishes like soups, salads, and main courses. However, some foods blur the line between fruits and vegetables. For example, in cooking, tomatoes and cucumbers are treated as vegetables even though they are technically fruits.",
