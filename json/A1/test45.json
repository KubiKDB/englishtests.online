  "passage": "<br>(1) Farmers work hard to grow delicious apples. First, they choose the right place to plant apple trees. Apple trees need good soil and plenty of sunlight. Farmers prepare the soil carefully before planting young trees. They add special materials to make the soil better for growing apples.<br><br>(2) After planting, farmers take care of the trees every day. They water the trees when it is dry and protect them from insects. In spring, the trees have beautiful flowers. Bees help the flowers make baby apples. Farmers sometimes put beehives near their trees to help this process.<br><br>(3) As summer begins, small green apples start to grow. Farmers check the trees often and remove some small apples. This helps the remaining apples grow bigger and sweeter. They also cut extra branches to let more sunlight reach the apples. During this time, farmers must protect their apples from birds and other animals.<br><br>(4) In autumn, the apples are ready to pick. Farmers know apples are ready when they have the right color and feel firm. They carefully pick each apple by hand to avoid damage. Some farmers use special machines to help with picking. After picking, they wash the apples and put them in boxes. Then, the apples go to stores where people can buy them.",
