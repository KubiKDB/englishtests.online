  "passage": "<br>(1) In autumn, many trees change the color of their leaves. During spring and summer, leaves are green. This is because they have a lot of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a substance that helps trees make food from sunlight. It also gives leaves their green color. But in autumn, something special happens to the leaves.<br><br>(2) When autumn comes, days get shorter and there is less sunlight. Trees know that winter is coming. They stop making chlorophyll. When this happens, the green color of the leaves starts to fade away. Then we can see other colors that were in the leaves all along: yellow, orange, and red.<br><br>(3) The yellow and orange colors come from substances called carotenoids. Carotenoids are in the leaves during the whole year, but we can only see them in autumn when the green chlorophyll goes away. The red color comes from a substance called anthocyanin. Trees make this substance in autumn when it is sunny during the day but cold at night.<br><br>(4) Different types of trees have different autumn colors. Maple trees often turn bright red. Oak trees usually turn brown or red. Birch trees turn yellow. The most beautiful autumn colors appear when there are many sunny days and cool nights. After the leaves change color, they fall from the trees. This is why autumn is also called 'fall' in some countries.",
