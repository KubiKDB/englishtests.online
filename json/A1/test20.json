  "passage": "<br>(1) Cacti are special plants that live in deserts. Deserts are very hot and dry places. There is very little water in deserts. Most plants cannot live there. But cacti can live in deserts because they are different from other plants.<br><br>(2) Cacti have special bodies that help them live with little water. They have thick, green stems that store water. These stems can hold water for a long time. Cacti do not have leaves like other plants. Instead, they have spines. Spines are sharp and keep animals away. Spines also help cacti stay cool in the hot sun.<br><br>(3) The roots of cacti are also special. They spread out near the top of the ground. When it rains, these roots quickly take in water. Cacti can take in a lot of water when it rains. Then they use this water slowly. This helps them live for a long time without rain.<br><br>(4) Inside a cactus, the water is safe. The thick skin of a cactus keeps the water from going away. Cacti also make a special kind of food. This food helps them grow even when there is little water. That is why cacti can live in the desert when other plants cannot.",
