  "passage": "<br>(1) Science labs are important rooms in schools. They give students a place to learn science in a special way. In science labs, students can touch and use real science tools. They can see how science works with their own eyes.<br><br>(2) When students work in science labs, they learn by doing. This is called 'hands-on learning.' Students can mix chemicals, look at small things with microscopes, or build simple machines. This helps them understand science better than just reading books.<br><br>(3) Science labs also teach students how to work together. Many experiments need more than one person. Students learn to share ideas and help each other. They learn how to solve problems as a team. These are important skills for life.<br><br>(4) Another reason schools have science labs is safety. Some science experiments can be dangerous. In a science lab, teachers can show students how to be safe. The lab has special tools to keep everyone safe, like eye protection and sinks for washing hands. This way, students can learn science in a safe place.",
