  "passage": "<br>(1) Some birds fly to warmer places when winter comes. This is called migration. These birds travel long distances to find food. They cannot find enough food during cold winters. Birds need to eat every day to stay alive.<br><br>(2) Birds use the sun, stars, and Earth's magnetic field to find their way. They often follow the same paths every year. Some birds travel in groups called flocks. Flying in a group helps keep them safe from danger. Young birds learn these paths from older birds.<br><br>(3) Many birds go to places near the equator in winter. The weather is warm there all year. There is plenty of food for them to eat. Some birds travel thousands of miles to reach these warm places. They fly very high in the sky during their journey.<br><br>(4) In spring, the birds return to their homes. They build nests and have babies. The cycle happens every year. Scientists study bird migration to learn more about these amazing animals. They put small tags on some birds to track where they go.",
