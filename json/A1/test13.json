  "passage": "<br>(1) Water can be a solid, a liquid, or a gas. As a solid, water is called ice. When the temperature rises above 0 degrees Celsius, ice starts to melt. This change from a solid to a liquid is called melting.<br><br>(2) When ice melts, it absorbs heat from its surroundings. This heat energy makes the water molecules move faster and break free from their fixed positions. The ice becomes smaller as it turns into liquid water. The shape and volume of the water change, but its weight stays the same.<br><br>(3) Melting ice affects our planet in many ways. In cold places like the Arctic and Antarctica, large areas of ice are melting because of global warming. When this ice melts, the sea level rises. This can cause flooding in coastal areas around the world.<br><br>(4) Melting ice is also important in everyday life. We use ice to keep our drinks cold. As the ice melts, it takes heat from the drink, making the drink cooler. We also see ice melting on roads and sidewalks when winter ends and spring begins.",
