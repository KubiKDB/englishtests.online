  "passage": "<br>(1) Bees are very important insects in our world. They help plants make fruits and seeds. When bees visit flowers to get food, they move yellow dust called pollen from one flower to another. This is called pollination. Without bees, many plants could not make fruits or seeds.<br><br>(2) When a bee visits a flower, some pollen sticks to its body. Then, when the bee flies to another flower, some of this pollen falls onto the new flower. This helps the plant make fruits with seeds inside. Apples, oranges, and many other fruits need bees to help them grow.<br><br>(3) Bees work very hard every day. One bee can visit up to 5,000 flowers in one day! Bees live together in big groups called hives. They work as a team to find food and make honey. Honey is the sweet food that bees make from flower nectar.<br><br>(4) Sadly, the number of bees in the world is going down. This is bad for plants and for people too. We need bees to help grow many of the foods we eat. If we want to have fruits and vegetables in the future, we must help protect bees now.",
