  "passage": "<br>(1) Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon. He was an American astronaut who went to space in 1969. The mission was called Apollo 11. Armstrong traveled with two other astronauts named Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins.<br><br>(2) On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin landed on the moon in a small spacecraft called the Eagle. Collins stayed in the main spacecraft and went around the moon. When Armstrong stepped onto the moon, he said the famous words: \"That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"<br><br>(3) Armstrong spent about two and a half hours walking on the moon. He and Aldrin took pictures, collected moon rocks, and put up an American flag. Millions of people on Earth watched this historic event on television. It was the first time humans had ever been on another world.<br><br>(4) After the moon mission, Armstrong became a teacher and businessman. He did not like being famous. He was a quiet man who believed the Apollo 11 mission was important for all people, not just for him. Armstrong died in 2012, but his achievement will always be remembered in history.",
