  "passage": "<br>(1) Kangaroos are special animals from Australia. They are famous for the way they carry their babies. A baby kangaroo is called a joey. When a joey is born, it is very tiny, about the size of a bean. It is not fully developed and cannot survive outside its mother's body.<br><br>(2) After birth, the joey moves to its mother's pouch. The pouch is like a pocket on the mother's stomach. The joey uses its small front legs to climb into the pouch. This journey is difficult and takes about three minutes. Inside the pouch, the joey drinks milk and continues to grow.<br><br>(3) The joey stays in the pouch for about six to eight months. At first, it never leaves the pouch. Later, it puts its head out to see the world. After some time, the joey starts to come out of the pouch for short periods. It jumps back into the pouch when it feels danger or needs food.<br><br>(4) Eventually, the joey becomes too big for the pouch. It starts spending more time outside but still returns to the pouch for safety and milk. By the time the joey is about 10 months old, it no longer fits in the pouch. However, it stays close to its mother and drinks milk for several more months. This special way of carrying babies helps kangaroos protect their young.",
