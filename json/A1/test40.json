  "passage": "<br>(1) The oceans are very important for our planet. They cover more than 70% of the Earth's surface. Oceans are home to many plants and animals. They also give us food, like fish and other seafood.<br><br>(2) Oceans help control our weather and climate. They absorb heat from the sun and move it around the world. This helps make the temperature good for living things. Oceans also make clouds and rain, which give us fresh water.<br><br>(3) People use oceans for travel and transport. Big ships carry things from one country to another. Many people work on these ships or in ports. Some people also use oceans for fun activities like swimming, sailing, and surfing.<br><br>(4) We need to take care of our oceans. Sometimes people put trash and chemicals in the water. This can hurt the plants and animals that live there. It can also make the water dirty for humans. If we keep our oceans clean, they will continue to help us in many ways.",
