  "passage": "<br>(1) Volcanoes are special mountains that can erupt with hot lava, ash, and gas. They form when hot melted rock, called magma, rises from deep inside the Earth. This magma collects in a chamber under the volcano. When the pressure becomes too high, the volcano erupts and sends the magma, now called lava, out through an opening called a vent.<br><br>(2) There are three main reasons why volcanoes erupt. First, when magma rises, gas bubbles form inside it. These bubbles create pressure, like in a soda bottle when you shake it. Second, when new magma enters the chamber, it pushes on the magma that is already there. Third, the weight of the mountain itself can squeeze the magma chamber.<br><br>(3) Scientists can sometimes predict when a volcano will erupt by watching for warning signs. These signs include small earthquakes, changes in the shape of the volcano, and increases in temperature and gas emissions. However, it is still difficult to know exactly when an eruption will happen.<br><br>(4) Volcanic eruptions can be dangerous, but they also bring benefits. The ash from volcanoes makes soil very rich, which is good for growing plants. Many beautiful tourist areas exist around volcanoes. Scientists also study volcanoes to learn more about how the Earth works.",
