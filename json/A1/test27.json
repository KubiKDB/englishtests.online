  "passage": "<br>(1) Frogs begin life in water. A female frog lays eggs in water. These eggs are very small. After a few days, baby frogs come out of the eggs. We call these baby frogs tadpoles. Tadpoles look very different from adult frogs. They have long tails and no legs. They can only live in water.<br><br>(2) As tadpoles grow, they start to change. First, they grow back legs. These legs help them swim better. Then, they grow front legs. The legs become stronger every day. At the same time, their tails become shorter. Tadpoles use their tails less and less as they grow legs.<br><br>(3) After about two months, tadpoles look more like frogs. They have four strong legs and almost no tail. Their bodies are bigger now. They also start to grow lungs. Lungs help them breathe air. Before this, tadpoles breathe through gills, like fish.<br><br>(4) Finally, the tadpoles become young frogs. They can now live on land. They have no tails. They have large back legs to help them jump. They have eyes that can see well on land. Adult frogs eat insects instead of plants. This change from tadpole to frog is called metamorphosis. It is an amazing process that shows how animals can change as they grow.",
