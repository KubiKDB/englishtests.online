  "passage": "<br>(1) The Amazon Rainforest is a beautiful place in South America. It is the largest rainforest in the world. Many plants and animals live there. The rainforest has tall trees, colorful birds, and interesting insects. People call it the 'lungs of the Earth' because it makes a lot of oxygen.<br><br>(2) Life in the Amazon is very busy. During the day, animals look for food and build homes. Birds sing in the trees, and monkeys jump from branch to branch. In the water, fish swim and play. At night, different animals come out. Some of them have special eyes to see in the dark.<br><br>(3) The Amazon River flows through the rainforest. It is one of the longest rivers in the world. Many people live near the river. They use boats to travel and to catch fish. The river is home to many animals too, like dolphins and turtles. Some of these animals cannot be found anywhere else in the world.<br><br>(4) The Amazon Rainforest is important, but it is in danger. People cut down trees to make farms and roads. This is called deforestation. When trees are cut down, animals lose their homes. The air also becomes less clean. Many people are working to protect the rainforest. They want to save this special place for the future.",
