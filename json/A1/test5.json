  "passage": "<br>(1) Animals use camouflage to hide from other animals. Camouflage helps animals stay safe in nature. Some animals change color to match their surroundings. This makes it hard for other animals to see them. Camouflage is very important for animal survival.<br><br>(2) There are different types of camouflage in the animal world. Some animals have spots or stripes that help them hide. For example, zebras have black and white stripes. Tigers have orange and black stripes that help them hide in tall grass. Some insects look like leaves or sticks to hide from birds.<br><br>(3) Many animals use camouflage to hide from animals that want to eat them. These animals are called prey. For example, rabbits have brown fur that helps them hide on the ground. Other animals use camouflage to catch food. These animals are called predators. Polar bears have white fur that helps them hide in the snow when they hunt.<br><br>(4) Camouflage can change with the seasons. Some animals have white fur in winter when there is snow. Their fur turns brown in summer when there is no snow. This helps them stay hidden all year. Camouflage is a special way that animals adapt to their environment to survive.",
