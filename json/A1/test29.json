  "passage": "<br>(1) Brushing your teeth is very important for your health. When you eat food, small pieces stay on your teeth. These food pieces mix with bacteria in your mouth and form plaque. Plaque can damage your teeth and make holes in them. These holes are called cavities.<br><br>(2) You should brush your teeth two times every day. Brush in the morning after breakfast and at night before you go to sleep. Use a toothbrush with soft bristles and toothpaste with fluoride. Fluoride helps make your teeth strong.<br><br>(3) When you brush your teeth, move the toothbrush in small circles. Brush all parts of your teeth - the front, the back, and the top. Don't forget to brush your tongue too. Brushing your tongue helps remove bacteria and keeps your breath fresh.<br><br>(4) If you don't brush your teeth, you can get many problems. Your teeth can become yellow and ugly. You can get bad breath. You can also get pain in your teeth and gums. Going to the dentist can be expensive. It is better to brush your teeth every day and prevent these problems.",
