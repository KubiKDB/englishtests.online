  "passage": "<br>(1) Dolphins are very special animals that live in oceans and seas around the world. They use different ways to talk to each other under the water. The main way dolphins communicate is through sounds. They make clicks, whistles, and other noises that travel far in water.<br><br>(2) Each dolphin has its own special whistle, like a name. When they meet other dolphins, they use this whistle to say hello. Dolphins can remember these special whistles for many years. This helps them find their friends and family members even in big groups.<br><br>(3) Dolphins also use their bodies to communicate. They jump out of the water, slap their tails, and swim in special ways. When dolphins are happy, they often jump and play. When they are afraid, they swim close together for safety. These movements help dolphins share their feelings with other dolphins nearby.<br><br>(4) Scientists study how dolphins communicate to understand these amazing animals better. They use special underwater microphones to record dolphin sounds. They also watch how dolphins move and act together. By learning more about dolphin communication, we can protect these smart animals and their homes in the ocean.",
