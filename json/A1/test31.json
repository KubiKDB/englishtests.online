  "passage": "<br>(1) Penguins are birds that live in cold places, but unlike most birds, they cannot fly. They have wings, but these wings are different. Penguin wings are short and flat, and look more like flippers. These flippers help penguins swim very fast in water, but they cannot use them to fly in the air. Penguins spend most of their time in water or on land.<br><br>(2) There are many reasons why penguins cannot fly. First, their bodies are heavy and not shaped for flying. Flying birds have light bones with air inside, but penguins have solid bones that help them dive deep in water. Second, their wings are too small compared to their body size. These wings are perfect for swimming, but they cannot lift the penguin's body into the air.<br><br>(3) Over millions of years, penguins changed to live better in their environment. Long ago, their ancestors could fly, but slowly they lost this ability. Instead, they became excellent swimmers. This change helped them find food and stay safe. In the cold water where penguins live, there are many fish to eat, and few animals that can hurt them.<br><br>(4) Today, penguins are perfectly adapted to their life between land and sea. They can swim faster than many fish and can hold their breath underwater for a long time. On land, they walk upright on two feet or slide on their bellies across the ice. While they cannot soar in the sky like other birds, penguins are successful in their own special way.",
