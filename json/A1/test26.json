  "passage": "<br>(1) The sun is very important for all life on Earth. It gives us light during the day. Without the sun, our planet would be dark and cold. Plants need sunlight to grow. Animals need plants for food. Humans need both plants and animals to live.<br><br>(2) The sun helps us stay healthy. When our skin gets sunlight, our body makes vitamin D. Vitamin D helps make our bones strong. The sun also helps us sleep better. When we see sunlight in the morning, our body knows it is time to be awake. When it gets dark, our body knows it is time to sleep.<br><br>(3) The sun gives us energy. We can use solar panels to change sunlight into electricity. This is clean energy that does not make pollution. Many houses and buildings now use solar panels on their roofs. Some cars can also use energy from the sun.<br><br>(4) The sun makes the weather on Earth. It heats the air and the water. This creates wind and rain. Different places on Earth get different amounts of sunlight. This is why some places are hot and some are cold. The sun is the reason we have different seasons like summer and winter.",
