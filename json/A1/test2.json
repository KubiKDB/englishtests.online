  "passage": "<br>(1) Islands are special places surrounded by water. They can be small or big. Some islands have many people living on them, while others have no people at all. Islands can be found in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers all around the world.<br><br>(2) Islands have special plants and animals. Many islands have animals and plants that you cannot find anywhere else. This is because these plants and animals have lived on the island for a very long time without meeting other types. The animals on islands are often not afraid of people because they have never seen people before.<br><br>(3) People like to visit islands for holidays. Islands often have nice beaches, clear water, and warm weather. Visitors can swim, fish, or just relax in the sun. Some people like to look at the special plants and animals on islands. Others like to learn about the people who live there and their way of life.<br><br>(4) Islands can be different from each other. Some islands are hot, and some are cold. Some have mountains, while others are flat. Some islands have a lot of rain, and others are very dry. But all islands are special because they are separate from the mainland and have their own special features.",
