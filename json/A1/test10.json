  "passage": "<br>(1) Many schools in the United States have sports teams. These teams let students play games like basketball, football, and soccer. Students who join these teams practice after school. They learn to work together and have fun.<br><br>(2) Sports teams help students in many ways. First, they help students stay healthy. When students run, jump, and play, they make their bodies stronger. Second, sports teach students how to be part of a team. They learn to help each other and work together to win games.<br><br>(3) Being on a sports team also teaches students important life skills. They learn to manage their time between school work and practice. They also learn that hard work helps them get better at sports. These skills help students do well in school and later in life.<br><br>(4) Finally, sports teams bring the school together. Other students, teachers, and parents come to watch games. They cheer for their team and feel proud of their school. This helps create a strong school community where everyone feels they belong.",
