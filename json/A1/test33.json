  "passage": "<br>(1) Earth has many fascinating places, but some are extremely cold. Antarctica is the coldest place on our planet. The temperature there can drop to -89°C. Scientists live there in special stations to study the weather and ice. No one lives in Antarctica permanently because it is too cold.<br><br>(2) Siberia in Russia is another very cold region. The town of Oymyakon is called the coldest inhabited place on Earth. In winter, temperatures can reach -50°C. Despite this extreme cold, about 500 people live there all year round. They have adapted to the harsh conditions over many generations.<br><br>(3) Greenland is also known for its freezing temperatures. Much of this island is covered with ice. The average temperature in winter is about -30°C. Unlike Antarctica, Greenland has towns and villages where people live and work. They build special houses to stay warm during the long, cold winters.<br><br>(4) Canada has some of the coldest cities in the world. Places like Yellowknife and Winnipeg experience temperatures below -30°C in winter. People in these cities wear many layers of clothes to stay warm. They also have special cars that can start in very cold weather. Schools sometimes close when it gets too cold for children to go outside.",
