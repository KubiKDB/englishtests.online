  "passage": "<br>(1) Studying for a test can be challenging, but with the right approach, it becomes easier. The first thing you should do is make a plan. Think about how much time you have before the test. Then, divide your study materials into small parts. This way, you won't feel overwhelmed.<br><br>(2) Find a quiet place to study where nobody will disturb you. Your study area should be clean and comfortable. Turn off your phone to avoid distractions. Having a good study environment helps you focus better and remember information more easily.<br><br>(3) One effective study method is to review your notes regularly. Read them carefully and highlight important points. You can also make flashcards with key information. Practice by testing yourself or asking a friend to quiz you. Remember that taking short breaks during study sessions helps your brain process information.<br><br>(4) Finally, take care of yourself before the test. Get enough sleep the night before. Eat a healthy breakfast on the test day. Arrive early to the test location so you don't feel rushed. Being calm and prepared will help you perform your best during the test.",
