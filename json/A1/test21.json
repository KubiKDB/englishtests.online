  "passage": "<br>(1) Hills and mountains are both high areas of land, but they are different in size. Hills are smaller than mountains. Hills are usually less than 600 meters high. They often have round tops and gentle slopes. You can walk up many hills in a few hours.<br><br>(2) Mountains are much higher than hills. They are usually more than 600 meters high. Some mountains are more than 8,000 meters high. Mountains often have sharp tops and steep sides. Many mountains have snow on top all year. It can take days to climb a mountain.<br><br>(3) Another difference is how hills and mountains are formed. Hills can be made when wind and water slowly wear down bigger mountains. They can also form when the ground moves up slowly. Mountains are usually formed when parts of the Earth's surface push against each other. This can happen over millions of years.<br><br>(4) Both hills and mountains are important for people and animals. Many people like to walk in hills because they are not too difficult to climb. Mountains can be dangerous, but they are beautiful to visit. Some animals and plants can only live on mountains because they need the special conditions there.",
