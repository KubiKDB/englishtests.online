  "passage": "<br>(1) Plants need water to live and grow, but they do not drink like animals do. Instead, plants have a special system to absorb water from the soil. This system begins with the roots, which are like small pipes that grow under the ground. The roots have tiny hairs that increase their surface area and help them collect more water from the soil.<br><br>(2) Once the water enters the roots, it moves up through the plant in tubes called xylem. Xylem tubes work like straws that carry water from the roots all the way up to the leaves. This movement of water is helped by a process called capillary action, which allows water to move upward against gravity through the small tubes in the plant.<br><br>(3) Another important process that helps plants drink water is transpiration. During transpiration, water evaporates from tiny holes in the leaves called stomata. As water leaves through the stomata, it creates a pulling force that draws more water up from the roots. This is similar to how drinking through a straw works.<br><br>(4) Plants also have ways to control how much water they use. During hot, dry weather, many plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. Some plants, like cacti, store water in their stems or leaves for use during dry periods. Other plants have special adaptations like waxy leaves that reduce water loss. These different methods help plants survive in various environments with different amounts of water.",
