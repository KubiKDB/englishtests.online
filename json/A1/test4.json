  "passage": "<br>(1) Some animals sleep during the winter months in a process called hibernation. When animals hibernate, their body temperature drops, and they use very little energy. This helps them survive when food is hard to find. Animals that hibernate include bears, hedgehogs, and some types of squirrels.<br><br>(2) Before hibernation begins, animals eat a lot of food. They need to build up fat in their bodies. This fat provides energy during their long sleep. Some animals also collect and store food to eat when they wake up for short periods during hibernation.<br><br>(3) Hibernation can last for different lengths of time. Some animals hibernate for just a few weeks, while others sleep for several months. The temperature outside affects how long animals hibernate. In colder places, animals usually hibernate for longer periods.<br><br>(4) Not all animals deal with winter in the same way. Some migrate to warmer places instead of hibernating. Others stay active and find food even in cold weather. Animals that hibernate have special adaptations that help them survive long periods without eating or drinking.",
