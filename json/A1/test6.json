  "passage": "<br>(1) Clouds can tell us a lot about the weather. Different types of clouds show us what the weather is like now and what it might be like soon. For example, dark gray clouds often mean that rain is coming. White, fluffy clouds usually mean the weather is nice and will stay that way.<br><br>(2) High, thin clouds called cirrus clouds look like white lines in the sky. They often mean that the weather will change in a day or two. Cumulus clouds are the big, white, fluffy clouds that look like cotton. They usually mean good weather, but if they grow very tall, they can turn into storm clouds.<br><br>(3) Storm clouds are called cumulonimbus clouds. They are very tall and dark at the bottom. These clouds bring heavy rain, thunder, and lightning. Another type of cloud is stratus clouds. These are flat, gray clouds that cover the whole sky like a blanket. They can bring light rain or snow.<br><br>(4) By looking at clouds, people can often predict the weather without special tools. Farmers, sailors, and pilots have used clouds to help them make decisions for hundreds of years. Today, scientists use satellites and computers to study clouds, but looking at the sky is still a simple way to know what weather to expect.",
