  "passage": "<br>(1) A librarian is a person who works in a library. Libraries are places where people can borrow books, use computers, and study. Librarians help people find the books and information they need. They know where all the different books are in the library. Librarians are very good at answering questions and helping people learn new things.<br><br>(2) One important job of a librarian is to organize books. They put books in the right places on shelves so people can find them easily. Librarians also choose new books for the library. They decide which books will be useful or interesting for people who visit the library. Sometimes they repair damaged books to keep them in good condition.<br><br>(3) Librarians also teach people how to use the library. They show visitors how to search for books on computers. They help students with their homework and research projects. Some librarians read stories to children during special story times. They create fun activities to help children enjoy reading and learning.<br><br>(4) Today, librarians do more than just work with books. They help people use computers and find information online. They organize community events in the library like book clubs and classes. Many libraries now have e-books that people can read on computers or tablets. Librarians teach people how to use these new technologies. The job of a librarian has changed, but they still help people find knowledge and information.",
