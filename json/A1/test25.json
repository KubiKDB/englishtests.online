  "passage": "<br>(1) Elephants eat many different plants every day. They are herbivores, which means they only eat plants. An adult elephant can eat up to 300 pounds of food in a single day. They spend most of their time looking for food and eating.<br><br>(2) In the morning, elephants like to eat grass. They use their trunks to pull the grass from the ground. Then they put the grass in their mouths. Elephants also eat leaves from trees. They can use their trunks to reach high branches. Sometimes they push small trees down to eat the leaves.<br><br>(3) During the afternoon, elephants look for fruits and vegetables. They love bananas, melons, and sweet potatoes. These foods give them energy. Elephants also need to drink a lot of water. An elephant can drink up to 50 gallons of water each day. They use their trunks like straws to drink.<br><br>(4) In the evening, elephants eat bark from trees. Bark has important nutrients that help keep elephants healthy. Elephants have large, flat teeth that help them chew tough plants. Their teeth wear down over time, but new teeth grow to replace the old ones. An elephant will have six sets of teeth during its life.",
