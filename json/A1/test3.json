  "passage": "<br>(1) Flowers are important parts of plants. Each flower has many different parts. The main parts of a flower include petals, sepals, stamens, and pistil. All these parts help the plant to make new seeds.<br><br>(2) The petals are often colorful and beautiful. They attract insects and birds to the flower. These animals help move pollen from one flower to another. The sepals are small green leaves that protect the flower when it is still a bud. They are usually found at the base of the flower.<br><br>(3) Inside the flower are the stamens and pistil. The stamens are thin structures that produce pollen. Pollen is a yellow powder that contains male cells. The pistil is in the center of the flower. It contains female cells in a part called the ovary. When pollen reaches the pistil, it can create seeds.<br><br>(4) After pollination, the petals often fall off. The ovary grows bigger and becomes a fruit. Inside the fruit are seeds. These seeds can grow into new plants. This is how flowers help plants to reproduce and make more plants. Each part of the flower has an important job to do.",
