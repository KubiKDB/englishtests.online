  "passage": "<br>(1) Learning to read at an early age is very important for children. When children learn to read early, they can understand more about the world around them. Reading helps children learn new words and ideas. Children who read early often do better in school later.<br><br>(2) Parents can help their children learn to read. They can read books to their children every day. They can also talk about the stories and ask questions. When parents show that reading is fun, children want to read more. Parents can also take their children to the library to find new books.<br><br>(3) Teachers also play a big role in helping children learn to read. They teach children the sounds of letters and how to put them together to make words. They help children practice reading every day. Teachers also choose books that are right for each child's reading level. This helps children feel good about reading.<br><br>(4) Reading early helps children in many ways. It makes their brains stronger and helps them think better. Reading also helps children learn how to write well. Children who read a lot often have better imaginations. They can think of new ideas and solve problems. Reading is a skill that helps children all through their lives.",
