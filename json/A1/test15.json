  "passage": "<br>(1) The giraffe is the tallest animal in the world. It can grow up to six meters tall. Most of this height comes from its very long neck and legs. Giraffes use their long necks to eat leaves from tall trees that other animals cannot reach.<br><br>(2) Giraffes have beautiful yellow and brown spotted coats. No two giraffes have the same pattern of spots, just like no two people have the same fingerprints. Giraffes live in Africa, in open areas with trees. They eat leaves, fruits, and flowers from tall trees.<br><br>(3) A giraffe's heart is very big and strong. It needs to pump blood all the way up its long neck to its brain. Giraffes sleep very little, only about two hours each day. They can sleep standing up. When they drink water, they must spread their front legs wide to reach the ground with their mouth.<br><br>(4) Baby giraffes are already very tall when they are born. A baby giraffe is about two meters tall at birth! Young giraffes stay with their mothers for about one and a half years. Sadly, the number of giraffes in the world is getting smaller. People need to help protect these amazing animals.",
