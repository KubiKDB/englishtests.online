  "passage": "<br>(1) A rainbow is a beautiful arc of colors in the sky. We can see rainbows after it rains. To see a rainbow, you need two things: water and sunlight. When the sun shines through raindrops, we can see a rainbow. The sun must be behind you, and the rain must be in front of you. This is why we often see rainbows in the late afternoon.<br><br>(2) Rainbows have seven colors. These colors are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Red is at the top of the rainbow, and violet is at the bottom. These colors always appear in the same order. You can remember the order of the colors with the name 'Roy G. Biv'. Each letter in this name stands for a color in the rainbow.<br><br>(3) Rainbows form because sunlight is made of many colors. When sunlight enters a raindrop, it bends. This bending is called refraction. Each color in sunlight bends at a different angle. This makes the colors separate. Then, the light reflects off the back of the raindrop. Finally, the light bends again when it leaves the raindrop.<br><br>(4) Every rainbow is a circle, but we usually see only half of it. This is because the ground blocks the lower half. If you are in an airplane, you might see a full rainbow circle. Sometimes, you can see two rainbows. The second rainbow is above the first one, and its colors are in the opposite order. Rainbows are not only in the sky. You can see small rainbows in soap bubbles, garden sprinklers, and waterfalls too.",
