  "passage": "<br>(1) Today was my first day at a new school. I was very nervous when I woke up. My mother helped me get ready. She made me a special breakfast and took a photo of me in my new uniform.<br><br>(2) When we arrived at the school, many students were already there. A nice teacher met us at the door. She showed me where my classroom was. The classroom was big and had colorful pictures on the walls.<br><br>(3) At lunch time, I sat alone. I did not know anyone yet. Then a girl named Lisa came and sat next to me. She asked if I wanted to play with her and her friends. I was happy to say yes. We played a fun game in the schoolyard.<br><br>(4) By the end of the day, I had made three new friends. I learned where the library was and how to find the bathroom. When my mother came to pick me up, I told her all about my day. I am not nervous anymore. I think I will like my new school.",
