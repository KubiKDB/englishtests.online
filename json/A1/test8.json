  "passage": "<br>(1) Rivers are important water bodies that flow across the land. Many of the world's longest rivers are famous for their size and beauty. The Nile River in Africa is the longest river in the world. It is 6,650 kilometers long and flows through eleven countries.<br><br>(2) The Amazon River in South America is the second longest river. While it is slightly shorter than the Nile, the Amazon carries more water than any other river. It is home to many types of fish and plants. The Yangtze River is the longest river in Asia and the third longest in the world.<br><br>(3) The Mississippi River is the longest river in North America. It is very important for transportation and trade in the United States. Many boats carry goods up and down this river every day. The Yenisei River in Russia is the fifth longest river in the world.<br><br>(4) These long rivers are all different, but they are all important to the people who live near them. They provide water for drinking and farming. They also help people travel from one place to another. Many cities around the world were built near rivers because rivers are so useful.",
