  "passage": "<br>(1) Deserts are places that get very little rain. Most deserts receive less than 25 centimeters of rain each year. This is why deserts are so dry. There are many deserts around the world, and they can be hot or cold.<br><br>(2) The main reason deserts have little rain is their location. Many deserts are found near the middle of continents, far from oceans. When air moves from the ocean to the land, it carries moisture. By the time this air reaches the middle of a continent, it has lost most of its moisture.<br><br>(3) Mountains can also cause deserts. When air hits a mountain, it goes up and over it. As the air rises, it cools and drops its moisture as rain. On the other side of the mountain, the air is dry. This creates what scientists call a 'rain shadow.' Deserts often form in these rain shadows.<br><br>(4) Another reason for desert formation is global air circulation. Air near the equator is warm and rises, creating rainy areas. This air then moves north and south. When it cools, it falls back to Earth around 30 degrees north and south of the equator. This falling air is very dry and creates desert conditions in these regions.",
