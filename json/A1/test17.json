  "passage": "<br>(1) Birds build their nests in many different ways. Some birds make simple nests on the ground, while others create complex structures in trees. Most birds collect materials like twigs, grass, and leaves to build their nests. They use their beaks and feet to gather these materials and shape them into nests.<br><br>(2) Different birds use different techniques to build nests. Some birds weave materials together to create strong, cup-shaped nests. Others dig holes in tree trunks or in the ground. Some birds, like eagles, make large nests that they use for many years, adding new materials each year.<br><br>(3) The location of a nest is very important for birds. They need to protect their eggs and young birds from danger. Many birds hide their nests in trees or bushes. Some birds build nests near other birds for protection. Other birds make nests in places that are hard for predators to reach, like on high cliffs.<br><br>(4) The time to build a nest can be different for each type of bird. Some birds build a nest in just one or two days. Other birds spend weeks making their nests perfect. Most birds build new nests every year, but some birds return to the same nest. Birds are amazing builders, creating homes that keep their babies safe until they can fly.",
