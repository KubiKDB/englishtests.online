  "passage": "<br>(1) Teachers play an important role in helping students learn. They create lesson plans that make learning fun and easy. Teachers explain difficult ideas in simple ways. They use books, pictures, and games to help students understand new things.<br><br>(2) Good teachers know that all students learn in different ways. Some students learn by seeing things. Other students learn by doing activities. Teachers try to use many different methods in class. This helps all students learn in the way that is best for them.<br><br>(3) Teachers also give students feedback on their work. They tell students what they did well and what they need to improve. This helps students understand their mistakes and learn from them. Teachers ask questions to check if students understand the lessons.<br><br>(4) Another important way teachers help students is by encouraging them. They celebrate when students do well and support them when they have problems. Teachers create a positive classroom where students feel safe to try new things. When students feel supported, they learn better and enjoy school more.",
