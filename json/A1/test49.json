  "passage": "<br>(1) Trees are very important for all living things on Earth. They help us by making oxygen. Oxygen is what we breathe to stay alive. Trees take in carbon dioxide from the air, which is a gas that we breathe out. Then, they use sunlight to change this carbon dioxide into oxygen and food for themselves.<br><br>(2) The process of making oxygen is called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis happens in the green leaves of trees. The leaves have a special green material called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps the tree use energy from the sun. This energy changes water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and sugar. Trees use the sugar for food, and they release the oxygen into the air.<br><br>(3) Trees make a lot of oxygen every day. One big tree can make enough oxygen for four people to breathe all day. Forests with many trees make huge amounts of oxygen. This is why forests are sometimes called the 'lungs of the Earth.' Without trees, we would not have enough oxygen to breathe.<br><br>(4) We need to take care of trees because they take care of us. When people cut down too many trees, there is less oxygen in the air. Planting new trees is a good way to help. Even one small tree can grow big and make more oxygen over time. We should all try to protect trees and forests for our future.",
