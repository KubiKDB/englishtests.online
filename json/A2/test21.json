  "passage": "<br>(1) Reptiles are interesting animals that live in many parts of the world. They have scales instead of fur or feathers. Most reptiles lay eggs, but some give birth to live babies. Reptiles are cold-blooded, which means their body temperature changes with the environment. They like to sit in the sun to get warm. When it is too hot, they move to the shade to cool down.<br><br>(2) Snakes are reptiles with long bodies and no legs. They move by sliding their bodies from side to side. Many people are afraid of snakes, but most snakes are not dangerous to humans. Snakes eat other animals like mice, birds, and frogs. They can open their mouths very wide to swallow their food whole. Some snakes, like pythons, squeeze their prey before eating it.<br><br>(3) Lizards are reptiles that usually have four legs and a long tail. Most lizards are small, but some, like the Komodo dragon, can be very large. Lizards can be many different colors. Some can even change their color to match their surroundings. Many lizards can lose their tails when attacked by a predator. The tail will grow back over time, which helps the lizard survive.<br><br>(4) Turtles are reptiles with hard shells that protect their bodies. The shell is actually part of the turtle's skeleton. Turtles can pull their head and legs inside their shell when they feel threatened. Some turtles live on land, and others live in water. Sea turtles have flippers instead of feet, which helps them swim. Turtles can live for a very long time, with some species living more than 100 years.",
