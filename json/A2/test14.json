  "passage": "<br>(1) The human body is an amazing machine. It has many different parts that work together. These parts include bones, muscles, and organs. Bones give the body its shape and protect organs inside. Muscles help the body move. Organs do special jobs to keep the body healthy.<br><br>(2) The brain is one of the most important organs. It controls everything the body does. The brain tells muscles when to move and helps us think and remember things. The heart is another important organ. It pumps blood to all parts of the body. Blood carries oxygen and food to cells. The lungs help us breathe by taking in oxygen and removing carbon dioxide.<br><br>(3) The digestive system is how the body processes food. When we eat, food goes into the stomach where it is broken down. Then it moves to the intestines, where nutrients are taken into the blood. The body uses these nutrients for energy and to build new cells. The kidneys clean the blood and remove waste from the body as urine.<br><br>(4) The skin is the largest organ of the body. It protects everything inside from germs and injury. Skin also helps control body temperature. When we are hot, we sweat, and when the sweat dries, it cools the body. When we are cold, we shiver, which helps warm the body. The human body truly works like a team, with each part doing its job to keep us alive and healthy.",
