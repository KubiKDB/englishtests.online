  "passage": "<br>(1) Markets are places where people buy and sell things. In a traditional market, sellers put their goods on tables or in shops. Buyers walk around and look at different items. When they find something they want, they ask the price. Sometimes, buyers can negotiate with sellers to get a lower price.<br><br>(2) There are many types of markets around the world. Some markets sell only food, like fruits, vegetables, and meat. Other markets sell clothes, toys, or electronics. Big markets often have sections for different types of products. This helps buyers find what they need more easily.<br><br>(3) To buy something, a customer first chooses the item they want. Then, they pay the seller with cash or a card. The seller gives the customer a receipt, which is a piece of paper that shows what was bought and how much it cost. If the customer pays with cash, the seller often gives them change.<br><br>(4) Today, many people also buy and sell things online. In online markets, sellers post pictures and descriptions of their products. Buyers look at these and decide what to buy. They pay with credit cards or digital payment methods. Then, the seller sends the products to the buyer's home or office. Online markets are convenient because people can shop without leaving their homes.",
