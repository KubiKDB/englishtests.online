  "passage": "<br>(1) Simple machines are tools that make work easier. They help us lift, move, or cut things every day. The lever is one of the most common simple machines. A seesaw in a playground is a type of lever. When you push down on one end, the other end goes up. Many tools like scissors, hammers, and can openers use levers to work.<br><br>(2) The wheel and axle is another simple machine we use all the time. Cars, bicycles, and shopping carts all have wheels. Wheels help us move heavy things with less effort. Door knobs are also wheel and axle machines. When you turn a door knob, the axle inside the door moves and opens the lock.<br><br>(3) Inclined planes or ramps are simple machines too. Instead of lifting something heavy straight up, we can push it up a ramp. This takes less force but more distance. Stairs are like small inclined planes that help us climb to higher places. Even the threads on screws are tiny inclined planes wrapped around the screw.<br><br>(4) Pulleys help us lift heavy objects more easily. A pulley is a wheel with a rope or cable around it. When you pull down on one end of the rope, you can lift something on the other end. Many window blinds use pulleys. Cranes at construction sites use big pulleys to lift very heavy materials. These simple machines are all around us and make our everyday tasks much easier.",
