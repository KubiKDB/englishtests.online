  "passage": "<br>(1) Mountains are the highest places on Earth. They are large, natural formations that rise high above the surrounding land. Mountains can be found on every continent. Some mountains stand alone, while others form long chains called mountain ranges. The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest, which is 8,848 meters tall and located in Asia.<br><br>(2) Mountains form in different ways. Most mountains form when parts of the Earth's crust push together. This happens very slowly over millions of years. Some mountains form when hot magma from inside the Earth pushes up through the surface. Mountains can also form when land is pushed up by movements in the Earth's crust. These natural processes continue to create and change mountains today.<br><br>(3) The climate on mountains is different from the areas below. As you go higher up a mountain, the air gets colder and thinner. For every 1,000 meters you climb, the temperature drops about 6 degrees Celsius. Many mountains have snow at the top all year round. The weather on mountains can change very quickly. It might be sunny one moment and stormy the next. Living on mountains can be difficult because of these harsh conditions.<br><br>(4) Despite the harsh conditions, mountains are home to many plants and animals. These living things have adapted to survive in the cold, thin air. Mountains are also important to humans. They provide water, food, and shelter for many people around the world. Mountains are popular places for hiking, skiing, and other outdoor activities. Many people visit mountains to enjoy their beauty and peaceful environment.",
