  "passage": "<br>(1) Maps help us find our way in new places. A map is a drawing that shows a place from above. It uses special symbols to show different things like roads, rivers, mountains, and buildings. Learning to read a map is a useful skill for travel and outdoor activities. Even with modern technology like GPS, knowing how to read a basic map is still important.<br><br>(2) The first thing to look for on a map is the compass. A compass shows directions: north, south, east, and west. North is usually at the top of the map. Next, find the scale. The scale tells you how distances on the map compare to real distances. For example, one inch on the map might equal one mile in the real world. This helps you understand how far things are from each other.<br><br>(3) Maps use different colors and symbols to show information. Blue usually means water, like rivers, lakes, or oceans. Green often shows forests or parks. Brown or orange might show mountains or high ground. Black lines are often roads, while red lines might be main highways. Cities and towns are usually shown as dots or squares. The map key or legend explains what all the symbols mean.<br><br>(4) To use a map, first find where you are. Look for landmarks around you that might be on the map. Then find where you want to go. Once you know your starting point and destination, you can plan your route. Follow the symbols for roads or paths to see how to get there. Remember to check the scale to know how far you need to travel. With a little practice, reading maps becomes easy and helpful.",
