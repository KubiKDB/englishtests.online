  "passage": "<br>(1) Many people around the world keep pets in their homes. Dogs and cats are the most popular pets. Dogs are friendly animals that need daily walks and lots of attention. They can learn tricks and often protect their owners. Cats are more independent and do not need as much care as dogs. They like to sleep during the day and play at night.<br><br>(2) Some people prefer smaller pets like fish or birds. Fish are quiet pets that live in tanks of water. They come in many beautiful colors and sizes. Birds such as parakeets and canaries can sing lovely songs. They live in cages but should be allowed to fly around the room sometimes.<br><br>(3) Other interesting pets include rabbits, hamsters, and turtles. Rabbits have soft fur and eat vegetables. They can live inside the house or outside in a special cage. Hamsters are very small and active at night. Turtles move slowly and can live for many years if you take good care of them.<br><br>(4) Having a pet requires responsibility. All pets need food, clean water, and a safe place to live. Some pets need regular visits to a veterinarian to stay healthy. Before choosing a pet, people should think about how much time and money they can spend on pet care. The right pet can bring a lot of happiness and become a true friend.",
