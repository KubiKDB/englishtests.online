  "passage": "<br>(1) Medieval times were an important period in European history from about 500 to 1500 CE. During this time, castles were built across Europe as homes for kings and nobles. These large stone buildings had thick walls and towers to protect the people inside. Most castles were surrounded by a deep ditch called a moat, which was often filled with water. This made it harder for enemies to attack the castle.<br><br>(2) Knights were special soldiers who fought on horseback. They wore heavy metal armor to protect their bodies during battle. It took many years to become a knight. Boys started training when they were very young. First, they worked as pages, helping around the castle. Later, they became squires and learned how to ride horses and use weapons. Finally, after proving their courage and skill, they were made knights in a special ceremony.<br><br>(3) Daily life inside a castle was busy. The great hall was the center of activity where people ate meals, held meetings, and celebrated special events. Servants worked hard to prepare food, clean, and take care of the castle. Children learned useful skills rather than studying in schools. Most people ate simple foods like bread, cheese, and vegetables. Meat was usually saved for special occasions or eaten only by wealthy people.<br><br>(4) Although castles were built for protection, they were not always comfortable places to live. Many rooms were cold and dark, especially in winter. There was no electricity, so people used candles and fireplaces for light and heat. There was no running water, so servants had to carry water from wells or nearby rivers. Despite these difficulties, medieval castles were important centers of power and still fascinate people today.",
