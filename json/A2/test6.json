  "passage": "<br>(1) Money is something that people use to buy things. It can be coins, paper notes, or even digital numbers in a bank account. Before money, people traded things directly. For example, a farmer might trade some corn for a new shirt. This was difficult because both people needed to want what the other person had.<br><br>(2) Money makes buying and selling easier. When everyone agrees that money has value, we can use it to get what we need. We work and earn money, then use that money to buy food, clothes, and other things. Money is accepted everywhere in a country because the government says it has value.<br><br>(3) There are different types of money around the world. Each country usually has its own money called a currency. For example, the United States uses dollars, while many European countries use euros. When people travel to other countries, they often need to exchange their money for the local currency.<br><br>(4) Today, many people use digital money. Instead of carrying cash, they pay with credit cards or through apps on their phones. The money still exists, but it's just numbers in a computer system. Whether it's coins in your pocket or numbers on a screen, money helps us get the things we need in our daily lives.",
