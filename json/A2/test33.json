  "passage": "<br>(1) Birds are amazing animals that we can find all over the world. They come in many different colors. Some birds are bright red, like cardinals. Others are blue, yellow, or green. Many birds are brown or black, which helps them hide from danger. The colors of birds often help them find mates or stay safe.<br><br>(2) Birds are known for their beautiful songs. Each type of bird has its own special song. Some birds sing early in the morning to greet the day. Others sing to attract a mate or to mark their territory. Many people enjoy listening to birds singing in their gardens or in parks. Bird songs can be short and simple or long and complex.<br><br>(3) Most birds build nests to lay their eggs and raise their young. Nests can be made from many different materials like sticks, grass, leaves, and mud. Some birds build their nests high in trees, while others make them on the ground or in holes. Robins often build cup-shaped nests in trees or bushes. Eagles make large nests of sticks that they use year after year.<br><br>(4) Birds take good care of their eggs and baby birds. They sit on their eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. Then they bring food to the baby birds many times each day. The parents protect their babies from danger until they are ready to fly and find food on their own. It is always exciting to see a baby bird leave its nest for the first time.",
