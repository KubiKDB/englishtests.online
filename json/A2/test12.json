  "passage": "<br>(1) Flowers are beautiful plants that we can see in gardens, parks, and forests. They have different colors, shapes, and sizes. People like flowers because they look pretty and smell nice. Flowers are also important for nature because they help plants make seeds and fruits.<br><br>(2) The life of a flower begins as a seed. When a seed gets water and sunlight, it starts to grow. First, a small root grows down into the soil to get water and nutrients. Then, a stem grows up from the ground. The stem gets taller and leaves start to grow on it. The plant needs leaves to make food from sunlight.<br><br>(3) After the plant grows strong, it starts to form a bud. The bud is a small, closed part where the flower is developing. When the bud is ready, it opens and becomes a flower. The flower has colorful petals that attract insects like bees and butterflies. The insects help the flower by moving pollen from one flower to another. This process is called pollination.<br><br>(4) When pollination happens, the flower can make seeds. The petals fall off, and the middle part of the flower grows into a fruit with seeds inside. When the seeds are ready, they fall to the ground or are carried away by wind, water, or animals. If the seeds find a good place with soil, water, and sunlight, they can grow into new plants, and the life cycle begins again.",
