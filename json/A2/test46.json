  "passage": "<br>(1) A budget is a plan that helps you manage your money. It shows how much money you have coming in and how much money you spend. Making a budget can help you save money for things you want. It can also help you avoid spending too much money. Many people make a budget every month to help them plan their expenses.<br><br>(2) To make a budget, first write down how much money you get each month. This is your income. You can get money from your job, from family, or from other places. Next, make a list of all the things you need to pay for. These are your expenses. Some expenses happen every month, like rent or food. Other expenses only happen sometimes, like buying new clothes or going to see a doctor.<br><br>(3) After you list your income and expenses, you can see if you are spending more money than you have. If you are spending too much, you need to find ways to spend less. You can look at your list of expenses and decide what things you can live without. Maybe you can eat at home more often instead of going to restaurants. Or maybe you can find a cheaper phone plan.<br><br>(4) It is a good idea to save some money every month. Saving money means you do not spend all of the money you have. When you save money, you can use it later for something important or for emergencies. Many people save money in a bank. Banks keep your money safe, and some banks even give you a little extra money for keeping your money with them. This is called interest.",
