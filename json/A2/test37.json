  "passage": "<br>(1) People have created simple inventions throughout history that changed our daily lives. One of the most important inventions was paper. The ancient Egyptians made paper from a plant called papyrus more than 5,000 years ago. Later, the Chinese created paper similar to what we use today around 105 CE. This invention helped people share information and ideas more easily.<br><br>(2) Another important invention was the pencil. In the 1500s, people discovered that graphite could make marks on paper. Early pencils were just pieces of graphite wrapped in string or sheep skin. In 1795, Nicholas-Jacques Conté created the modern pencil by mixing graphite with clay and putting it in a wooden case. Pencils made writing and drawing much simpler for everyone.<br><br>(3) The umbrella is another useful invention with a long history. People in ancient Egypt, China, and Greece all used umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun. These early umbrellas were made from leaves, feathers, or paper. In the 1700s, people in Europe started using umbrellas for rain protection. Today, umbrellas help millions of people stay dry when it rains.<br><br>(4) The zipper is a more recent invention that we use every day. Elias Howe patented an early version called the \"automatic continuous clothing closure\" in 1851. However, it wasn't very practical. In 1913, Gideon Sundback created the modern zipper with metal teeth that lock together. The zipper made it much easier to close clothing, bags, and many other items. These simple inventions show how creative ideas can make our lives better.",
