There are seven continents: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. Asia is the largest continent, while Australia is the smallest.<br><br>(2) The four main oceans are the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.

The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean and separates Europe and Africa from North and South America.<br><br>(3) Each continent has different countries, languages, and cultures. For example, Asia has 48 countries including China, India, and Japan. Africa has 54 countries and is known for its wildlife and deserts. Europe is home to countries like France, Germany, and Italy. The Americas have countries such as the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Mexico.<br><br>(4) Oceans are important for many reasons. They provide food and help control the weather and climate.
