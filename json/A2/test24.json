  "passage": "<br>(1) The Roman Empire was one of the most powerful civilizations in history. It began as a small town in Italy around 753 BCE. Over time, Rome grew into a vast empire that ruled much of Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. The Romans were excellent builders and created many roads, bridges, and buildings that still exist today.<br><br>(2) Daily life in ancient Rome was interesting. Rich Romans lived in large houses with beautiful gardens. Poor people lived in small apartments in crowded buildings. Most Romans ate simple food like bread, cheese, vegetables, and sometimes meat. Children went to school to learn reading, writing, and mathematics. Many Romans enjoyed watching sports and plays in their free time.<br><br>(3) The Roman army was very strong and well-organized. Soldiers trained hard and followed strict rules. Each soldier carried heavy equipment and weapons. The army helped Rome conquer new lands and defend its borders. Roman soldiers built forts and walls to protect the empire. One famous wall is Hadrian's Wall in Britain, which marked the northern edge of the empire.<br><br>(4) The Roman Empire finally fell in 476 CE, but its influence continues today. Many modern languages come from Latin, which was spoken by the Romans. Our laws, government systems, and architecture also show Roman influence. The Roman Empire left a lasting mark on Western civilization that we can still see in our daily lives.",
