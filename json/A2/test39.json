  "passage": "<br>(1) Animals live in many different places around the world. These places are called habitats. A habitat is a natural home where animals find the food, water, and shelter they need to survive. Some animals live in forests, while others prefer deserts, mountains, or oceans. Each animal has special features that help it live in its particular habitat.<br><br>(2) Forests are home to many kinds of animals. Squirrels climb trees to find nuts and build nests high above the ground. Bears find berries to eat and caves for shelter. Birds make nests in tree branches and catch insects. The thick trees in forests provide protection from bad weather and places to hide from danger.<br><br>(3) Desert habitats are very hot and dry. Animals that live in deserts, like camels and lizards, have special ways to save water. Camels can go for long periods without drinking. Many desert animals stay underground during the day when it is very hot and come out at night when it is cooler. They find food and water in desert plants or by eating other animals.<br><br>(4) Ocean habitats cover most of our planet. Fish have fins that help them swim through water. Whales and dolphins come to the surface to breathe air. Crabs and starfish live on the ocean floor. Some ocean animals, like sharks, swim constantly, while others, like coral, stay in one place their whole lives. Each animal is perfectly suited to its habitat.",
