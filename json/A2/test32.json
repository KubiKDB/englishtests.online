  "passage": "<br>(1) The Olympic Games started in ancient Greece nearly 3,000 years ago. Athletes from different Greek cities competed in events like running, boxing, and wrestling. These games took place in Olympia every four years. They were very important to the Greeks and during the games, all wars stopped so athletes could travel safely to compete.<br><br>(2) The ancient Olympic Games continued for almost 1,200 years until they were banned in 393 CE. For many centuries, there were no Olympic Games. Then, in 1896, a Frenchman named Baron Pierre de Coubertin started the modern Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. Only 14 countries participated, and there were just 43 events.<br><br>(3) The modern Olympics grew quickly. In 1900, women competed for the first time. In 1924, the first Winter Olympic Games took place in Chamonix, France, with sports like skiing and ice skating. Today, both the Summer and Winter Olympics happen every four years, but they are scheduled two years apart from each other.<br><br>(4) The Olympic Games bring together thousands of athletes from more than 200 countries. They compete in hundreds of events over several weeks. The Olympic symbol of five connected rings represents the five continents of the world. When athletes win, they receive medals: gold for first place, silver for second place, and bronze for third place. The Olympics continue to be a celebration of sports, peace, and international friendship.",
