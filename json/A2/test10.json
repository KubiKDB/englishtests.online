  "passage": "<br>(1) The jungle is home to many wild animals that have adapted to life among the trees and plants. Tigers, monkeys, snakes, and birds live together in this natural environment. During the day, monkeys swing from branch to branch looking for fruit to eat, while colorful birds fly above the trees.<br><br>(2) At night, the jungle becomes a different place. Many animals sleep, but others wake up and start to hunt. Tigers silently walk through the forest looking for food. Snakes hide in dark places, waiting for small animals to pass by. The jungle is never completely quiet, even at night.<br><br>(3) Each animal has its own way of surviving in the jungle. Monkeys use their long arms and legs to move quickly through the trees. Birds have bright colors that help them hide among colorful flowers and leaves. Tigers have striped fur that makes them difficult to see when they hide in tall grass or between trees.<br><br>(4) Life in the jungle can be dangerous, but animals have developed special skills to stay safe. Some animals live in groups for protection, while others rely on speed to escape from predators. Many jungle animals have excellent hearing and can detect danger before it gets too close. Despite the challenges, these amazing creatures continue to thrive in their natural habitat.",
