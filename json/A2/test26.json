  "passage": "<br>(1) In Ancient Greece, people believed in many gods and goddesses who lived on Mount Olympus. Zeus was the king of the gods, and his wife Hera was the queen. The Greeks told stories about these gods to explain natural events. For example, they believed that thunder happened when Zeus was angry. These stories, called myths, were an important part of their culture.<br><br>(2) Daily life in Ancient Greece was different depending on if you were rich or poor, a man or a woman. Men spent time outside the home, working or discussing politics. Women usually stayed at home, taking care of children and making clothes. Children from wealthy families went to school, but poor children had to work. Most Greeks lived in small houses made of stone or clay with just a few rooms.<br><br>(3) Food was simple for most people in Ancient Greece. They ate bread, olive oil, cheese, vegetables, and fruits. Meat was expensive, so they only ate it during special festivals. Wine was a common drink, but they usually mixed it with water. Meals were an important time for families to gather together, and wealthy people sometimes held dinner parties with friends.<br><br>(4) The Ancient Greeks gave us many things we still use today. They created the first democracy in Athens, where citizens voted on important decisions. They built beautiful temples and statues, many of which still exist. Greek thinkers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle developed ideas about philosophy and science. The Olympic Games also began in Ancient Greece as a way to honor their gods and show physical strength.",
