  "passage": "<br>(1) The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth. It can grow up to 30 meters long and weigh as much as 200 tons. Blue whales are mammals, which means they breathe air, have hair, and feed their babies milk. They need to come to the surface of the water to breathe through their blowholes.<br><br>(2) These giant animals eat very small creatures called krill. A blue whale can eat up to 4 tons of krill in one day. They swim with their huge mouths open and filter the krill from the water. Despite their enormous size, blue whales cannot eat large fish or other large sea animals because their throats are too narrow.<br><br>(3) Blue whales are found in all of the world's oceans. They usually travel alone or in small groups. They communicate with each other using very loud sounds that can travel for hundreds of kilometers underwater. These sounds are too low for humans to hear without special equipment.<br><br>(4) Unfortunately, blue whales are an endangered species. Their numbers decreased greatly because of hunting in the past. Today, they are protected by international laws, but they still face dangers from ship strikes, getting caught in fishing nets, and water pollution. Scientists around the world are working to protect these amazing animals.",
