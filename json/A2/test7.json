  "passage": "<br>(1) On a farm, there are many different animals that live and work together. Cows are large animals that give us milk. Farmers milk the cows twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Chickens are smaller birds that give us eggs. They live in a special house called a chicken coop, where they lay eggs almost every day. Pigs live in a pen and eat almost anything, including leftover food.<br><br>(2) Sheep are animals with thick, woolly coats. Farmers cut the wool from sheep once a year in the spring, and this wool is used to make clothes. Horses are strong animals that help farmers with heavy work. In the past, horses pulled plows to prepare fields for planting. Today, many farms use tractors instead, but some farmers still keep horses for riding or for fun.<br><br>(3) Dogs and cats also live on farms. Farm dogs help to protect the farm and sometimes help to move animals from one place to another. Cats catch mice and rats that might eat the grain that is stored on the farm. Ducks and geese are birds that swim in farm ponds. They give eggs and meat, and some people also keep them as pets.<br><br>(4) Farm animals need good care. Farmers feed them every day and make sure they have clean water to drink. They clean the places where the animals live and check that the animals are healthy. When the weather is very cold or hot, farmers make sure the animals have shelter. Working with farm animals is hard work, but many farmers say they enjoy taking care of their animals.",
