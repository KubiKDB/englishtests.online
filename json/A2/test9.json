  "passage": "<br>(1) Seeds are the beginning of new plant life. They contain everything a new plant needs to start growing. Inside each seed is a tiny plant called an embryo. The seed also has food stored inside it. This food gives the new plant energy to grow until it can make its own food from sunlight.<br><br>(2) For a seed to grow, it needs the right conditions. First, a seed needs water. When a seed absorbs water, it swells up and the outer covering becomes soft. This process is called imbibition. Next, the seed needs the right temperature. Most seeds grow best in warm conditions, but some need cold temperatures first.<br><br>(3) After the seed has enough water and is at the right temperature, germination begins. The embryo inside starts to grow. First, a small root called a radicle breaks through the seed coat and grows downward into the soil. The radicle helps the new plant take in water and nutrients from the soil. Then, a shoot grows upward toward the light.<br><br>(4) As the shoot reaches the surface, it develops its first leaves. These leaves are called cotyledons or seed leaves. They help the young plant make food through photosynthesis. With water, nutrients from the soil, and energy from the sun, the seedling continues to grow into a mature plant. This amazing process of growth from a tiny seed to a full plant shows how nature works in wonderful ways.",
