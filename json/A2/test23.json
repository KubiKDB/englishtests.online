  "passage": "<br>(1) Earth has different climate zones. Some places are hot, some are cold, and others are mild. The climate of a place depends on how close it is to the equator, how high it is above sea level, and how near it is to an ocean. Climate affects the plants and animals that can live in each area. It also affects how people live their lives.<br><br>(2) Hot climate zones are near the equator. In these places, it is warm all year. Many tropical rainforests are in hot zones. People who live in hot climates often have houses with good air flow to stay cool. They may wear light clothes and eat foods that grow well in warm weather. Some hot places get a lot of rain, while others are very dry.<br><br>(3) Cold climate zones are near the North and South Poles. These areas have long, cold winters and short, cool summers. Not many plants can grow in cold climates because of the low temperatures. People in cold areas need warm clothes and houses with good heating. They often eat foods that can be stored for a long time. Many cold places have snow for several months each year.<br><br>(4) Mild climate zones are between hot and cold zones. These areas have four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. The temperature changes throughout the year, but it is rarely extremely hot or cold. Many different types of plants and animals can live in mild climates. People in these areas often change their activities based on the season. They may swim in summer and ski in winter.",
