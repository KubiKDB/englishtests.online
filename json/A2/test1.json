  "passage": "<br>(1) The Age of Discovery was a time when Europeans began to explore the world by sea. It started in the early 15th century and continued until the 17th century. During this period, many countries, especially Portugal and Spain, sent sailors to find new trade routes to Asia. They wanted to buy spices, silk, and other valuable goods directly from Asian countries instead of paying high prices to merchants who brought these items to Europe by land.<br><br>(2) Christopher Columbus was one of the most famous explorers of this time. In 1492, he sailed west from Spain hoping to reach Asia. Instead, he landed in the Americas, which Europeans called the 'New World.' Columbus made four voyages across the Atlantic Ocean and helped Spain claim lands in the Caribbean. Although he never found a route to Asia, his journeys changed history by connecting Europe with the Americas.<br><br>(3) Another important explorer was Ferdinand Magellan. In 1519, he left Spain with five ships to find a western route to the Spice Islands in Asia. Magellan's expedition became the first to sail around the world, although Magellan himself died in the Philippines before completing the journey. Only one of his ships returned to Spain in 1522, with just 18 of the original 270 men. Despite these losses, the expedition proved that the Earth was round and that all the world's oceans were connected.<br><br>(4) Vasco da Gama was a Portuguese explorer who found a sea route to India. In 1497, he sailed from Portugal around the southern tip of Africa and reached India in 1498. This new route allowed European countries to trade directly with Asia without using the old land routes controlled by other nations. Da Gama's discovery helped Portugal build a trading empire in Asia and made his country very rich. His journey was one of the most important events of the Age of Discovery.",
