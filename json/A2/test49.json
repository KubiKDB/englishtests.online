  "passage": "<br>(1) Energy is very important in our daily lives. We use energy to cook food, to drive cars, and to power our homes. There are many different sources of energy. Three of the most common natural sources are the sun, wind, and water.<br><br>(2) The sun gives us solar energy. Solar panels can change sunlight into electricity. This kind of energy is clean and does not run out. Many homes now have solar panels on their roofs. In sunny places like deserts, large solar farms can make electricity for thousands of homes.<br><br>(3) Wind is another clean source of energy. Wind turbines are tall machines with big blades. When the wind blows, it turns these blades to make electricity. Wind farms can be built on land or in the sea. Countries like Denmark and Germany use a lot of wind energy.<br><br>(4) Water can also create energy. This is called hydroelectric power. Fast-moving water from rivers or waterfalls turns special wheels called turbines. These turbines then make electricity. Big dams like the Hoover Dam in the United States create a lot of electricity this way. Water energy is powerful and does not cause pollution.",
