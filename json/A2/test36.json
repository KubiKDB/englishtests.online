  "passage": "<br>(1) The polar regions are the coldest places on Earth. They are found at the top and bottom of our planet. The Arctic is in the north, and Antarctica is in the south. Both regions are covered with ice and snow for most of the year. Very few people live in these cold places.<br><br>(2) The Arctic is an ocean surrounded by land. Countries like Russia, Canada, and the United States have territory in the Arctic. Polar bears, seals, and arctic foxes live there. Indigenous peoples such as the Inuit have lived in the Arctic for thousands of years. They have special skills for surviving in the cold weather.<br><br>(3) Antarctica is very different from the Arctic. It is a continent covered by a thick layer of ice. No countries own Antarctica, but scientists from many nations work there in research stations. There are no permanent human residents in Antarctica. Animals that live in Antarctica include penguins, seals, and whales. These animals have adapted to the extreme cold.<br><br>(4) Both polar regions are changing because of global warming. The ice is melting faster every year. This affects the animals and people who live in these regions. Scientists study the polar regions to understand how our planet's climate is changing. Protecting these unique environments is important for the future of Earth.",
