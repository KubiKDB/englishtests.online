  "passage": "<br>(1) Going to the zoo is a fun activity for people of all ages. Many families visit the zoo on weekends or holidays. At the zoo, you can see many different animals from around the world. Some zoos are very big and have hundreds of animals, while others are smaller but still interesting to visit.<br><br>(2) When you first enter the zoo, you might see monkeys swinging in trees or elephants using their trunks to pick up food. Lions and tigers are often popular animals that visitors want to see. These big cats usually sleep during the day, but sometimes they walk around their areas. Visitors must stay behind barriers for safety.<br><br>(3) Many zoos today try to create natural habitats for their animals. Instead of small cages, animals have larger spaces that look like their homes in the wild. This helps the animals feel more comfortable. Zoos also have special feeding times when visitors can watch the animals eat. These events are educational and help people learn about animal behavior.<br><br>(4) Most zoos also have places where visitors can rest and eat. There are usually benches near animal areas where people can sit and watch the animals. Many zoos have restaurants or cafes that sell food and drinks. At the end of the day, visitors often stop at the gift shop to buy souvenirs like toy animals or t-shirts to remember their fun day at the zoo.",
