  "passage": "<br>(1) Trade is when people exchange goods or services. It happens when one person has something that another person wants. For example, a farmer might have extra vegetables that a fisherman wants. The fisherman can trade fish for the farmer's vegetables. In this way, both people get what they need without using money.<br><br>(2) Trade has existed for thousands of years. Long ago, people in different villages traded with each other. They exchanged things like food, tools, and clothes. As time passed, trade between different countries became common. Ships carried goods across oceans, and people learned about new products from far away.<br><br>(3) Today, trade happens all over the world. Countries buy and sell products to each other every day. Some countries grow food, while others make cars or computers. Trade helps countries get things they cannot produce themselves. For example, countries with cold weather buy fruits that grow only in warm places.<br><br>(4) Modern trade is different from trade in the past. Now, people can buy products online from other countries. Companies ship goods quickly around the world. Money is usually used instead of exchanging one item for another. However, the basic idea of trade is still the same â€“ people exchange things they have for things they want.",
