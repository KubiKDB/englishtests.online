  "passage": "<br>(1) Deserts are some of the driest places on Earth. They receive very little rain each year. Most deserts are covered with sand, rocks, and hard ground. The temperature in deserts can be very hot during the day, but it can become cold at night. There are several types of deserts in different parts of the world.<br><br>(2) Animals and plants that live in the desert have special ways to survive. Desert animals often come out at night when it is cooler. Many desert plants have long roots to find water deep under the ground. Some plants can store water in their leaves or stems. These plants can survive for a long time without rain.<br><br>(3) People also live in deserts. They build houses that help them stay cool in the hot desert climate. Many desert homes have thick walls to keep the heat out. Some desert people are nomads who move from place to place to find food and water. They have learned how to live in these difficult conditions for thousands of years.<br><br>(4) Deserts can be beautiful places with amazing views. Visitors come to see the colorful rocks and sand. The front of a sand dune can change shape when the wind blows. Desert sunsets are often very beautiful with bright red and orange colors. Even though deserts seem empty, they are full of life and interesting things to discover.",
