  "passage": "<br>(1) Banks are places where people keep their money safe. When you put money in a bank, it stays there until you need it. Most people have a bank account. A bank account is like a special box for your money. You can put money in your account or take money out. Banks keep your money safe so you do not need to worry about losing it.<br><br>(2) There are many ways to use your bank account. You can use a bank card to buy things in shops or online. You can also use your card to take money out from a machine called an ATM. Some people like to use their phones to pay for things. This is called mobile banking. Mobile banking lets you check how much money you have at any time.<br><br>(3) Saving money is important. When you save money, you do not spend it right away. Instead, you keep it for later. Many people save money for big things they want to buy, like a car or a house. Some people save money for emergencies. Banks can help you save money. When you put money in a savings account, the bank gives you a little extra money. This extra money is called interest.<br><br>(4) It is good to think about how you spend your money. Before you buy something, ask yourself if you really need it. Make a list of things you need to buy each month, like food and clothes. Then, see how much money you have left. Try to save some of this money. Remember, saving a little money each month can add up to a lot of money over time.",
