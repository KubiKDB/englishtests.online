  "passage": "<br>(1) Insects are small creatures that live all around us. They have six legs and three body parts: the head, thorax, and abdomen. There are more than one million different types of insects on Earth. Some common insects include ants, bees, butterflies, and flies. Despite their small size, insects are very important for our planet.<br><br>(2) Many insects help plants grow. Bees, butterflies, and other insects move pollen from one flower to another. This helps plants make seeds and fruit. Without these helpful insects, we would not have many of the fruits and vegetables we eat. Some insects also help clean the environment by eating dead plants and animals.<br><br>(3) Not all insects are helpful to humans. Mosquitoes can spread diseases when they bite people. Some insects eat crops in fields or gardens. Termites can damage wooden houses. However, even these insects play important roles in nature. They are food for birds, fish, and other animals in the food chain.<br><br>(4) Scientists study insects to learn more about them. They have found that some insects can lift objects fifty times heavier than their own bodies. Others can jump very high or fly very fast. Some insects, like ants, work together in large groups. Scientists also use insects to help develop new medicines. Although insects are small, they have a big impact on our world.",
