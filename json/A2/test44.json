  "passage": "<br>(1) Small businesses are an important part of our economy. They provide jobs for many people and offer different services to customers in their communities. Unlike large companies, small businesses are usually owned by one person or a small group of people. These businesses can be found in almost every town and city around the world.<br><br>(2) Starting a small business can be both exciting and challenging. The owner must find a good location, buy necessary equipment, and hire workers. They also need to create a plan for how to make money. Many small business owners work long hours, especially when they first open their shops. They often have to do many different jobs themselves.<br><br>(3) There are many types of small businesses. Some sell food, like bakeries and restaurants. Others provide services, such as hair salons and repair shops. Some small businesses sell handmade products or specialty items that cannot be found in big stores. Today, many small businesses also sell their products online to reach more customers.<br><br>(4) Small businesses face many challenges. They must compete with large companies that can often sell products at lower prices. They also need to find ways to attract customers and keep them coming back. However, small businesses have advantages too. They can offer personal service and build strong relationships with their customers. Many people prefer to support local small businesses because they feel connected to their community.",
