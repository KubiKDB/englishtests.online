  "passage": "<br>(1) Islands are special places that are surrounded by water. They can be found in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers around the world. Some islands are very small, while others are quite big. Many people like to visit islands because they are beautiful and quiet.<br><br>(2) There are two main types of islands: continental islands and oceanic islands. Continental islands were once connected to a continent or mainland. Oceanic islands were formed by volcanoes under the ocean. Both types of islands have their own special plants and animals that live there.<br><br>(3) Life on an island can be different from life on the mainland. Island communities often have their own cultures and traditions. People who live on islands sometimes have to bring food and other things from the mainland. Many island people work as fishermen or in tourism because many travelers like to visit islands for holidays.<br><br>(4) Islands face some problems today. Rising sea levels caused by climate change are a danger to many low islands. Some small islands might disappear under the water in the future. It is important to protect islands and help the people who live on them.",
