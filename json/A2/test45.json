  "passage": "<br>(1) Prices affect our daily lives in many ways. Every time we go shopping, we look at the prices of things we want to buy. Sometimes we decide not to buy something because it costs too much. Other times, we buy more of something because it is on sale. Prices help us decide what to buy and how much to spend.<br><br>(2) Food prices are especially important for most families. When the cost of basic foods like bread, milk, and eggs goes up, families have to spend more money on groceries. This means they might have less money for other things they need or want. Some people may change what they eat when prices increase. They might buy cheaper foods or eat at restaurants less often.<br><br>(3) Transportation costs also affect our daily choices. When the price of gas is high, people may drive less. They might take the bus, walk, or ride bicycles instead. Some families decide to buy cars that use less gas. Others may choose to live closer to their work or school to save money on transportation. Rising transportation costs can change how we travel and where we live.<br><br>(4) Housing is another area where prices matter a lot. When house prices or rent costs go up, people may need to live in smaller homes or move to different neighborhoods. Young adults might live with their parents longer because they cannot afford their own places. Some families share homes to save money. The cost of housing can determine where we live and with whom we live.",
