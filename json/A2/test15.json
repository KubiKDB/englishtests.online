  "passage": "<br>(1) Saving money is an important skill that everyone should learn. When you save money, you put some of your money in a safe place for the future. This could be in a bank account or even in a special jar at home. Saving money helps you prepare for unexpected expenses, like when your phone breaks or your car needs repairs.<br><br>(2) There are many ways to save money. First, you can make a budget to plan how you will spend your money each month. A budget helps you see where your money goes and where you can spend less. Second, you can look for sales when you shop. Buying things when they cost less means you can save more money.<br><br>(3) Another good idea is to save a small amount of money regularly. For example, you can save $10 or $20 from each paycheck. Over time, these small amounts add up to a larger sum. Some people also use apps on their phones to help them save money. These apps can remind you to save and show you how much money you have saved.<br><br>(4) Saving money gives you more choices in life. With savings, you can buy important things like a car or a house. You can also pay for education to learn new skills. During difficult times, your savings can help you pay for food and housing. Many financial experts recommend saving at least 10% of your income each month. Starting to save money when you are young is a good habit that will help you all your life.",
