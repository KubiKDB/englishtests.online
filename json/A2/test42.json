  "passage": "<br>(1) The ocean is home to many amazing marine animals. These animals come in different sizes and colors. Some are very small, like tiny fish, while others, like whales, are very large. Marine animals live in all parts of the ocean, from the surface to the deepest areas.<br><br>(2) Fish are the most common marine animals. They have gills to breathe underwater and fins to help them swim. Some fish live alone, while others swim in large groups called schools. Sharks are a type of fish that many people fear, but most sharks are not dangerous to humans.<br><br>(3) Marine mammals are another important group of sea animals. These include whales, dolphins, and seals. Unlike fish, marine mammals breathe air through lungs. They must swim to the surface regularly to breathe. Whales and dolphins are known for being very intelligent animals. They communicate with each other using special sounds.<br><br>(4) The ocean floor is home to many interesting creatures too. Crabs and lobsters walk along the bottom using their many legs. Starfish and sea urchins move slowly across rocks and sand. Octopuses are very smart animals that can change their color to hide from predators. All these different animals make the ocean a fascinating place full of life.",
