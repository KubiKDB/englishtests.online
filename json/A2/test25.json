  "passage": "<br>(1) Our Solar System is our home in space. At the center is the Sun. The Sun is a star. It is very hot and gives us light and heat. Without the Sun, there would be no life on Earth. The Sun is much bigger than any planet.<br><br>(2) There are eight planets in our Solar System. The planets closest to the Sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These are called the inner planets. They are made mostly of rock. Earth is where we live. It is the only planet we know that has life.<br><br>(3) The outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. They are much bigger than the inner planets and are made mostly of gas. Jupiter is the biggest planet. Saturn is famous for its beautiful rings. Uranus and Neptune look blue because of the gases in their atmospheres.<br><br>(4) All planets move around the Sun in paths called orbits. The time a planet takes to go around the Sun once is called a year. Mercury is closest to the Sun and takes only 88 Earth days to orbit. Neptune is the farthest planet and takes 165 Earth years to go around the Sun once.",
