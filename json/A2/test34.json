  "passage": "<br>(1) In ancient times, transportation was very simple. People often walked from place to place. When they needed to carry heavy items, they used basic carts. Early carts had two wheels and were pulled by animals like horses or oxen. These carts helped farmers take their crops to markets in nearby towns. People who lived near water used small boats made of wood. The first boats were simple and moved with paddles.<br><br>(2) As time passed, boat designs improved. People learned to use the wind to move their boats by adding sails. With sails, boats could travel longer distances across rivers, lakes, and seas. This made trade between different regions possible. Merchants could sell goods from their homeland and bring back new items from far away. Boats were especially important for fishing communities that depended on the water for food.<br><br>(3) On land, carts became bigger and stronger. Some had four wheels instead of two, which made them more stable. Rich people used covered carts for travel, which protected them from rain and sun. Special carts were designed to carry specific goods like water, grain, or building materials. In some places, people built roads to make travel by cart easier and faster.<br><br>(4) Both boats and carts were essential for early human societies. They helped spread ideas, culture, and technology between different groups of people. When communities could trade with each other, they shared knowledge and skills. The development of these early forms of transportation was an important step in human history. Without carts and boats, cities might not have grown, and civilizations might have developed differently.",
