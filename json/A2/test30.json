  "passage": "<br>(1) Forests and jungles are amazing green worlds full of life. A forest is a large area with many trees growing close together. Jungles, also called rainforests, are forests with very hot, wet weather and even more plants and animals. Both forests and jungles are home to thousands of different plants and animals. Trees in these places help clean our air by taking in carbon dioxide and giving out oxygen. They also provide homes for birds, insects, and many other creatures.<br><br>(2) Forests cover about 30 percent of the Earth's land. They grow in many different places, from cold northern countries to hot areas near the equator. Some forests have trees that lose their leaves in winter, while others stay green all year. The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest jungle in the world. It is so big that more than 50 million different types of insects live there! Scientists believe that there are still many plants and animals in the Amazon that they haven't discovered yet.<br><br>(3) People use forests in many ways. We get wood from trees to build houses and make paper. Many medicines come from plants that grow in jungles. Some people who live in or near forests gather food, such as fruits, nuts, and honey. Forests are also beautiful places where people can walk, camp, and enjoy nature. Unfortunately, humans are cutting down too many trees for wood or to clear land for farms. This is called deforestation, and it is a serious problem.<br><br>(4) Protecting forests and jungles is very important. When we cut down too many trees, animals lose their homes, and some may become extinct. Deforestation also contributes to climate change because fewer trees mean less carbon dioxide is removed from the air. Many countries now have laws to protect forests, and some areas are national parks where cutting trees is not allowed. People are also working to plant new trees in areas where forests have been destroyed. By taking care of our forests and jungles, we can help protect these amazing green worlds for future generations.",
