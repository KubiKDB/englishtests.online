  "passage": "<br>(1) Weather is what happens in the sky every day. It can be sunny, rainy, windy, or cloudy. Climate is the usual weather in a place over many years. Some places have hot climates, while others have cold climates. Weather can change quickly, but climate changes slowly over time.<br><br>(2) Rain is an important part of weather. Rain happens when water drops fall from clouds. But how does water get into clouds? Water from oceans, lakes, and rivers turns into vapor when it gets warm. This process is called evaporation. The water vapor goes up into the sky and forms clouds.<br><br>(3) When the air gets cold, the water vapor in clouds turns back into water drops. This process is called condensation. If the drops get big enough, they become too heavy to stay in the air. Then they fall to the ground as rain. If the air is very cold, the drops freeze and fall as snow or hail.<br><br>(4) Rain is important for all living things. Plants need rain to grow. Animals need plants for food, and they also need water to drink. People also need water for drinking, cooking, and washing. Without rain, life on Earth would not be possible. That is why understanding how rain forms is important for everyone.",
