  "passage": "<br>(1) Many animals around the world are in danger of disappearing forever. These animals are called endangered species. When the last animal of a species dies, we say that species is extinct. Today, there are more than 41,000 species on the endangered list. This includes mammals, birds, fish, and many others.<br><br>(2) Why are so many animals in danger? One big reason is that humans destroy their homes. When we cut down forests or build cities, animals lose the places where they live. Another problem is pollution. Dirty air and water make it hard for animals to survive. Some animals are also hunted too much by people who want their fur, skin, or other parts.<br><br>(3) Protecting endangered animals is very important. First, every animal has a special role in nature. When one animal disappears, it affects many others. Second, animals help humans in many ways. Some give us medicine, food, or materials. Finally, animals make our world more beautiful and interesting. Future children deserve to see these amazing creatures.<br><br>(4) There are many things we can do to help. We can create special areas where animals are safe. We can make laws against hunting endangered animals. We can also reduce pollution and plant more trees. Even small actions like recycling or using less plastic can help. Everyone needs to work together to protect these special animals before it's too late.",
