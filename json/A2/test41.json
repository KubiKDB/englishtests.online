  "passage": "<br>(1) The Industrial Revolution began in Britain in the late 1700s and soon spread to other parts of Europe and North America. This period marked a major turning point in history as people started using machines to make goods instead of making them by hand. Before this time, most people worked at home or in small workshops, but the Industrial Revolution changed where and how people worked. New factories opened in cities, and many people moved from the countryside to find jobs in these factories.<br><br>(2) One of the most important inventions of this time was the steam engine. Steam engines used coal to produce power for machines in factories and later for trains and ships. This made it possible to transport goods and people much faster than before. Another key invention was the spinning jenny, which allowed workers to make cloth much more quickly. These and other machines helped businesses produce more goods at lower costs, which meant more people could afford to buy them.<br><br>(3) While the Industrial Revolution brought many benefits, it also created problems. Working conditions in early factories were often dangerous and unhealthy. People worked long hours for little pay, and even young children had to work. Cities grew quickly as people moved to find factory jobs, but there wasn't enough housing for everyone. This led to overcrowded and dirty living conditions where diseases spread easily. The air and water also became polluted from factory smoke and waste.<br><br>(4) Despite these problems, the Industrial Revolution changed the world forever. It led to new inventions and scientific discoveries that improved people's lives in many ways. Products that were once luxury items became affordable for ordinary people. The revolution also created new types of jobs and opportunities. Today, many countries around the world are still going through their own industrial revolutions, as they build factories and develop their economies.",
