  "passage": "<br>(1) Rivers are important water bodies that flow across the land. They start at a source, often in mountains or hills, and travel to their mouth, which is usually the ocean or a lake. Rivers carry fresh water that plants, animals, and people need to live. Many cities around the world were built near rivers because they provide water for drinking and growing food.<br><br>(2) Rivers also help people in many other ways. In the past, people used rivers to travel from one place to another before there were roads. Today, some rivers are still used for transportation of goods and people. Rivers can also be used to make electricity through dams. When water flows through a dam, it creates power that can be turned into electricity for homes and businesses.<br><br>(3) Animals and plants depend on rivers too. Fish, frogs, and many insects live in rivers. Birds and larger animals often come to rivers to drink water and find food. Plants grow along riverbanks, creating special areas called habitats. These habitats are home to many different living things, making rivers important for nature.<br><br>(4) Unfortunately, many rivers today are facing problems. Pollution from factories, farms, and cities makes the water dirty and harmful. Climate change is causing some rivers to dry up or flood more often. People are working to protect rivers by cleaning them, using less water, and making better laws. Rivers are valuable resources that connect our past, present, and future.",
