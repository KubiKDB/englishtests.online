  "passage": "<br>(1) Supply and demand are basic concepts in economics that help us understand how prices are determined in a market. Supply refers to how much of a product businesses can offer to customers. When supply increases, prices usually go down. When supply decreases, prices tend to go up.<br><br>(2) Demand refers to how much of a product consumers want to buy. When demand increases, prices usually rise because more people want the same product. When demand decreases, prices often fall because fewer people want to buy the product.<br><br>(3) The point where supply and demand meet is called the equilibrium. At this point, the quantity of goods that businesses want to sell equals the quantity that consumers want to buy. The price at this point is called the equilibrium price, and it represents the market value of the product.<br><br>(4) Several factors can affect supply and demand. For supply, these factors include production costs, technology, and the number of sellers. For demand, factors include consumer income, preferences, and the price of related goods. Understanding these factors helps businesses and consumers make better decisions.",
