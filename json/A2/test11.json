  "passage": "<br>(1) Humans have five main senses that help us understand the world around us. These senses are sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Each sense works using different parts of our body. Our senses collect information and send it to our brain. Then, our brain helps us understand what we are experiencing.<br><br>(2) The eyes are for seeing. They let us see colors, shapes, and movement. The ears are for hearing. They help us listen to sounds like music, voices, and noises. Our nose is for smelling. It can detect many different smells in the air around us. Some smells are pleasant, like flowers or food, while others are not.<br><br>(3) Our tongue is for tasting. It can recognize four main tastes: sweet, sour, salty, and bitter. When we eat food, our tongue sends messages to our brain about how the food tastes. Our skin is for touching. It covers our whole body and helps us feel things like hot, cold, soft, hard, wet, or dry.<br><br>(4) All five senses work together to give us a complete picture of our world. Sometimes, one sense may not work well, and people learn to use their other senses more. For example, people who cannot see often have very good hearing. Our senses are always working, even when we are sleeping. They help keep us safe and make life more enjoyable.",
