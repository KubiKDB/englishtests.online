  "passage": "<br>(1) Mahatma Gandhi was born in India in 1869. As a young man, he studied law in London. After he finished his studies, Gandhi worked as a lawyer in South Africa. While there, he saw how people were treated unfairly because of their skin color. This made him very sad and angry. He decided to fight against this unfair treatment in a peaceful way. Gandhi did not believe in using violence to solve problems.<br><br>(2) When Gandhi returned to India, he became a leader who helped his country become free from British rule. He taught people to protest without fighting. One famous action was his Salt March in 1930. At that time, Indians had to pay a tax on salt. Gandhi walked 240 miles to the sea to make his own salt. Thousands of people joined him. This simple act showed how unfair the laws were.<br><br>(3) Gandhi lived a very simple life. He wore plain white clothes that he made himself. He ate basic vegetarian food and often fasted as a way to protest. Many people called him 'Mahatma', which means 'great soul'. He spent time in prison because of his beliefs, but he never changed his mind about using peaceful methods. His ideas about non-violence influenced many other leaders around the world.<br><br>(4) In 1947, India finally became an independent country. Sadly, Gandhi did not live long after this great achievement. He was killed in 1948 by a man who did not agree with his views. Even though Gandhi died, his ideas live on. Many important leaders, like Martin Luther King Jr. in America, used Gandhi's peaceful methods to fight for equal rights. Gandhi showed that it is possible to make big changes without using force.",
