  "passage": "<br>(1) Water is always moving around our planet. This movement is called the water cycle. The water cycle has several important steps. The sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers. Then, the water changes from liquid to gas. This process is called evaporation.<br><br>(2) After water evaporates, it rises into the air as water vapor. As it goes higher, the air becomes cooler. The water vapor then changes back into tiny water droplets. We can see these droplets as clouds. This process is called condensation. The tiny droplets join together to form bigger drops.<br><br>(3) When the water drops become too heavy, they fall to the ground as rain. Sometimes, if the air is very cold, the water freezes and falls as snow or hail. This process is called precipitation. Precipitation is how water returns to the earth's surface.<br><br>(4) After precipitation, water flows over the land into rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some water goes into the ground. Plants use some of this water to grow. Eventually, most water returns to the oceans. Then the water cycle starts again with evaporation. The water cycle is very important for all living things.",
