  "passage": "<br>(1) Plants are amazing living things. They make their own food using sunlight, water, and air. This process is called photosynthesis. Plants use special parts called leaves to catch sunlight. Leaves are like small food factories for plants.<br><br>(2) The process starts when plants take in water through their roots. The water travels up the stem to the leaves. At the same time, plants take in a gas called carbon dioxide from the air. This gas enters the plant through tiny holes in the leaves called stomata.<br><br>(3) Inside the leaves, there is a green material called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll helps the plant use the energy from sunlight. When sunlight hits the leaves, chlorophyll captures this energy. Then, the plant uses this energy to change water and carbon dioxide into food called glucose and oxygen.<br><br>(4) Plants use glucose as food to grow bigger and stronger. They release the oxygen back into the air. This oxygen is what humans and animals breathe. So plants not only feed themselves but also help other living things. Without plants, there would be no oxygen for us to breathe, and no food for us to eat.",
