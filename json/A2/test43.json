  "passage": "<br>(1) Ancient Egypt was one of the world's first great civilizations. It began around 3100 BCE when King Menes united Upper and Lower Egypt. The ancient Egyptians built amazing structures called pyramids. These huge stone buildings served as tombs for the pharaohs, who were the kings of Egypt. The Egyptians believed that pharaohs would become gods in the afterlife, so they prepared the tombs very carefully.<br><br>(2) The most famous pyramids are at Giza, near modern Cairo. The Great Pyramid of Giza was built for Pharaoh Khufu around 2560 BCE. It was the tallest human-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Workers moved more than two million stone blocks to build this pyramid. Each block weighed about 2.5 tons. Even today, people wonder how the ancient Egyptians built such impressive structures without modern technology.<br><br>(3) Pharaohs ruled ancient Egypt for thousands of years. They wore special clothes and carried symbols of their power, like the crook and flail. Famous pharaohs include Tutankhamun, who became king when he was only nine years old, and Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt. Pharaohs had absolute power over their kingdom and were thought to be living gods on Earth. They controlled the government, led the army, and made important decisions about farming and building projects.<br><br>(4) The ancient Egyptians developed many important things we still use today. They created a writing system called hieroglyphics, made paper from papyrus plants, and designed a 365-day calendar. They also made advances in medicine, mathematics, and art. The civilization of ancient Egypt lasted for more than 3,000 years before it finally ended when Rome conquered Egypt in 30 BCE. Today, people from all over the world visit Egypt to see the pyramids and learn about the amazing achievements of this ancient civilization.",
