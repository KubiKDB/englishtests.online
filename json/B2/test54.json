  "passage": "<br>(1) The Scientific Revolution, which spanned roughly from the mid-16th to the late 17th century, represented one of the most significant shifts in human understanding of the natural world. Before this intellectual transformation, European thought was largely dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and religious doctrine, which explained natural phenomena through theological frameworks. As new methods of inquiry emerged, scholars began to question traditional authorities and seek evidence-based explanations for the workings of the universe.<br><br>(2) At the heart of this revolution was the development of the scientific method, a systematic approach to investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge. Figures like Francis Bacon championed empirical research and inductive reasoning, while René Descartes emphasized the importance of skepticism, mathematical analysis, and deductive logic. These complementary approaches established a foundation for modern scientific inquiry that valued observation, experimentation, and mathematical precision over appeals to ancient texts or religious authorities.<br><br>(3) Perhaps the most profound conceptual shift came from astronomy. When Nicolaus Copernicus proposed his heliocentric model, suggesting that the Earth orbited the Sun rather than vice versa, he challenged not just astronomical understanding but humanity's very place in the cosmos. This revolutionary idea was later supported by Galileo Galilei's telescopic observations and ultimately formalized in Isaac Newton's laws of motion and universal gravitation, which provided a comprehensive mathematical framework explaining everything from falling apples to planetary orbits.<br><br>(4) Advances in medicine and biology similarly transformed perceptions of the human body and its relationship to the natural world. Andreas Vesalius's detailed anatomical studies corrected errors that had persisted in medical knowledge for centuries, while William Harvey's discovery of blood circulation replaced ancient notions of bodily humors with mechanical explanations. Robert Boyle's work in chemistry began to reveal the fundamental properties of matter and air, challenging the four-element theory that had dominated for millennia.<br><br>(5) The Scientific Revolution fundamentally altered how humans perceived reality, replacing a world governed by divine purpose and qualitative relationships with one that operated according to discoverable, mathematical laws. This mechanistic worldview suggested that the universe functioned like a giant clock, with interconnected parts working according to predictable principles. While this perspective brought extraordinary technological and intellectual advances, it also raised profound questions about human significance in an increasingly quantifiable cosmos—questions that continue to resonate in contemporary discussions about science, philosophy, and meaning.",
