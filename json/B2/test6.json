  "passage": "<br>(1) Global climate zones are primarily determined by the Earth's geography, which influences temperature, precipitation, and weather patterns. The most significant geographical factor is latitude, as it affects the angle and intensity of sunlight. Areas near the equator receive direct sunlight year-round, resulting in consistently high temperatures and the formation of tropical climates. In contrast, regions near the poles receive sunlight at an oblique angle, leading to cooler temperatures and polar climates.<br><br>(2) Another crucial geographical feature is altitude. Higher elevations experience cooler temperatures due to the thinning atmosphere, which reduces heat retention. This is why mountainous regions, even those near the equator, can have temperate or even cold climates. For example, the Andes in South America have alpine climates at high altitudes, despite being located in tropical latitudes.<br><br>(3) Proximity to bodies of water also plays a significant role in shaping climate zones. Oceans and large lakes moderate temperatures by absorbing and releasing heat slowly. Coastal areas tend to have milder, more stable climates compared to inland regions at the same latitude. This is evident in the difference between the maritime climate of Western Europe and the continental climate of Eastern Europe.<br><br>(4) Ocean currents further influence climate by transporting warm or cold water across vast distances. The Gulf Stream, for instance, carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico to the North Atlantic, significantly warming the climate of Western Europe. Conversely, the California Current brings cold water from the North Pacific, contributing to the cooler coastal climate of California.<br><br>(5) Finally, prevailing wind patterns, shaped by the Earth's rotation and geographical features, distribute heat and moisture around the globe. The trade winds, for example, blow from east to west in the tropics, facilitating the movement of warm, moist air and influencing rainfall patterns. These winds, combined with other geographical factors, create diverse climate zones that support a wide range of ecosystems and human activities.",
