  "passage": "<br>(1) Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that form over many years from compacted snow. They are powerful agents of erosion and deposition, shaping the landscape in profound ways. As glaciers move, they carve out valleys, deposit moraines, and create fjords, leaving behind distinctive landforms that tell the story of their presence.<br><br>(2) One of the most notable features created by glaciers is the U-shaped valley. Unlike V-shaped valleys formed by rivers, glacial valleys have a characteristic U-shape with steep sides and a flat bottom. This shape is the result of the glacier's movement, which erodes the valley floor and sides through a process called plucking and abrasion. Plucking involves the glacier freezing onto rocks and pulling them away, while abrasion occurs as the glacier drags rocks along the valley floor, grinding down the bedrock.<br><br>(3) Moraines are another significant glacial landform. They are accumulations of debris, such as rocks, soil, and sediment, that have been transported and deposited by a glacier. There are several types of moraines, including terminal moraines, which mark the furthest extent of a glacier's advance, and lateral moraines, which form along the sides of a glacier. These deposits provide valuable information about the glacier's history and movement.<br><br>(4) Fjords are long, narrow inlets with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial erosion. They form when a glacier carves a valley below sea level, and after the glacier retreats, the valley is flooded by the sea. Fjords are typically found in regions with high mountains and a history of glaciation, such as Norway, Alaska, and New Zealand. They are not only striking natural features but also important for understanding past climate changes.<br><br>(5) In conclusion, glaciers play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's surface through the creation of valleys, moraines, and fjords. These landforms are not only aesthetically impressive but also serve as important indicators of past glacial activity and climate conditions. Studying these features helps scientists understand the dynamics of glaciers and their impact on the environment.",
