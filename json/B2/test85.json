  "passage": "<br>(1) The Great Barrier Reef, stretching over 2,300 kilometers along Australia's northeastern coast, stands as the world's largest coral reef ecosystem and one of the most diverse natural wonders on our planet. This magnificent living structure is composed of nearly 3,000 individual reefs and 900 islands, forming a complex mosaic of marine habitats that supports an extraordinary variety of life. The reef was formed gradually over millions of years as generations of tiny coral polyps built upon the skeletal remains of their predecessors, creating the massive calcium carbonate structure we see today.<br><br>(2) Home to over 1,500 species of fish, 400 types of coral, 4,000 varieties of mollusks, and countless other marine organisms, the Great Barrier Reef represents a pinnacle of biodiversity. Its waters host endangered species such as the dugong (sea cow) and various sea turtles, while also serving as a breeding ground for humpback whales that migrate from Antarctica. The reef's ecological complexity creates numerous specialized habitats—from shallow intertidal zones to deep oceanic trenches—each supporting distinct communities of organisms that have evolved intricate relationships over thousands of years.<br><br>(3) Despite its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site and its protection under Australia's Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, this natural wonder faces unprecedented threats. Climate change remains the most significant challenge, as rising ocean temperatures have triggered several mass coral bleaching events since the late 1990s. When water temperatures exceed corals' tolerance thresholds, they expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn white and potentially die if conditions don't improve quickly. Additionally, ocean acidification, resulting from increased absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide, weakens coral structures by making it more difficult for corals to extract calcium carbonate from seawater.<br><br>(4) Human activities closer to shore compound these global threats. Agricultural runoff introduces excess nutrients and pesticides into reef waters, promoting algal growth that competes with corals for space and light. Coastal development, including port expansions and dredging, increases sedimentation that can smother coral polyps and reduce the sunlight reaching them. Overfishing disrupts the delicate balance of reef ecosystems, especially when key species that control algal growth are removed. Even tourism, while economically valuable and raising awareness about conservation, can cause damage through boat anchors, sunscreen chemicals, and physical contact with fragile coral formations.<br><br>(5) Conservation efforts to protect the Great Barrier Reef have intensified in recent years, adopting a multi-faceted approach that addresses both local and global threats. The Australian government has implemented stricter regulations on agricultural practices in watershed areas and has expanded no-take zones where fishing is prohibited. Innovative restoration techniques, including coral nurseries where resilient coral species are cultivated and then transplanted to damaged areas, show promise for reef recovery. Scientists are also investigating methods to enhance coral resilience through selective breeding and assisted evolution. Perhaps most importantly, there is growing recognition that saving the Great Barrier Reef ultimately depends on addressing climate change through global reductions in greenhouse gas emissions—a challenge that requires unprecedented international cooperation.",
