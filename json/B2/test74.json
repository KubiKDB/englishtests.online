  "passage": "<br>(1) The Age of Exploration, spanning roughly from the early 15th to the late 17th century, represented one of the most transformative periods in human history. European nations, motivated by a combination of economic ambition, religious zeal, and scientific curiosity, launched expeditions across uncharted waters that would forever change the global landscape. Portugal, under the guidance of Prince Henry the Navigator, pioneered these maritime ventures, developing advanced navigation techniques and ships designed specifically for long ocean voyages. These technological innovations enabled explorers to venture further into the Atlantic than ever before, eventually rounding Africa's Cape of Good Hope and establishing trade routes to Asia.<br><br>(2) Spain soon joined the race for discovery, financing Christopher Columbus's westward journey in 1492 that accidentally encountered the Americas. This momentous encounter initiated a dramatic exchange of plants, animals, diseases, and ideas known as the Columbian Exchange. European crops like wheat and livestock transformed American agriculture, while American crops such as potatoes, tomatoes, and corn revolutionized European diets and farming. Unfortunately, this exchange also brought devastating diseases to indigenous populations who lacked immunity, resulting in catastrophic population declines throughout the Americas.<br><br>(3) The economic impact of these voyages was profound and far-reaching. Traditional trade routes controlled by Middle Eastern and Italian merchants were circumvented as direct sea routes to Asia were established. Portugal created a vast trading network stretching from Brazil to Japan, while Spain extracted enormous wealth from silver mines in the Americas. This influx of resources fueled European economic growth but also contributed to significant inflation. Meanwhile, the first truly global trade networks emerged, connecting previously isolated regions and creating new patterns of commerce that would lay the groundwork for today's global economy.<br><br>(4) Culturally and intellectually, the Age of Exploration challenged existing worldviews and expanded European knowledge. Medieval geographic conceptions were rendered obsolete as maps were redrawn to include newly discovered lands. Encounters with diverse civilizations forced Europeans to reconsider their understanding of humanity and their place in the world. Scientific knowledge advanced as explorers documented unfamiliar plants, animals, and celestial observations. The era's discoveries contributed significantly to the Scientific Revolution and the gradual shift toward more empirical approaches to understanding the natural world.<br><br>(5) However, the Age of Exploration also had profoundly destructive consequences. European powers established colonial systems that exploited indigenous populations and resources. The transatlantic slave trade, which forcibly transported millions of Africans to work in American colonies, created lasting patterns of inequality and suffering. Native societies throughout the Americas, Africa, and parts of Asia experienced cultural disruption, political subjugation, and in some cases, complete collapse. These complex legacies of exploration continue to shape our world today, reminding us that historical progress often comes with significant human costs and ethical contradictions.",
