  "passage": "<br>(1) Plastic pollution has become one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste are discarded, much of it ending up in natural ecosystems like rivers, forests, and oceans. This problem stems largely from the widespread use of single-use plastics, such as bags, bottles, and packaging, which are designed for convenience but often not recycled. Poor waste management systems in many regions exacerbate the issue, allowing plastics to escape into the environment.<br><br>(2) Once in nature, plastic waste has devastating consequences for wildlife. Animals often mistake plastic for food, leading to starvation when their stomachs fill with indigestible material. Marine species, such as turtles and seabirds, are particularly vulnerable, with studies showing that over 90% of some seabird populations have ingested plastic. Additionally, plastics break down into microplastics—tiny particles that infiltrate soil and water, posing risks to entire food chains.<br><br>(3) The causes of plastic pollution are tied to both human behavior and industrial practices. Overproduction by companies seeking profit, coupled with a lack of consumer awareness about recycling, drives the accumulation of waste. Governments often fail to enforce regulations, leaving corporations unaccountable. Meanwhile, the durability of plastic, once a celebrated feature, now ensures it persists in the environment for centuries.<br><br>(4) The environmental impact extends beyond wildlife to human health and climate. Microplastics have been found in drinking water and seafood, raising concerns about long-term toxicity. Furthermore, producing and disposing of plastics releases greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming. Estimates suggest that plastic-related emissions could triple by 2050 if current trends continue unchecked.<br><br>(5) Addressing plastic pollution requires collective action. Innovations like biodegradable materials offer hope, but they must be paired with stricter laws and better recycling infrastructure. Public education campaigns can also shift habits, encouraging people to reduce their reliance on disposable plastics. Without urgent steps, the damage to ecosystems and human well-being will only deepen.",
