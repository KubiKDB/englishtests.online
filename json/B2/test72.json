  "passage": "<br>(1) Water scarcity, a growing global crisis, occurs when the demand for freshwater exceeds its supply, affecting millions of people across diverse regions. This issue arises from a mix of natural and human-induced causes, such as prolonged droughts, overpopulation, and inefficient water use. While water covers much of the planet, only a tiny fraction is usable, making its uneven distribution a pressing concern. Regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia bear the brunt of this challenge, struggling with limited access to clean water.<br><br>(2) Climate change stands out as a primary driver of water scarcity. Rising temperatures accelerate evaporation, reducing surface water in rivers and lakes. In areas like the Middle East, prolonged dry spells have depleted groundwater reserves, leaving communities reliant on shrinking resources. Scientists predict that these patterns will worsen, with arid regions facing even greater strain as rainfall becomes less predictable.<br><br>(3) Human activity further aggravates the problem. Agriculture, which consumes vast amounts of water, often relies on outdated irrigation methods that waste more than they deliver. Industrial pollution also plays a role, contaminating rivers and aquifers in places like South Asia, where rapid urbanization adds pressure to already scarce supplies. Poor governance, including a lack of regulation, allows over-extraction to continue unchecked in many areas.<br><br>(4) Geographically, water scarcity varies widely. The Sahel region in Africa, for instance, suffers from chronic shortages due to its desert climate and sparse rainfall, forcing residents to travel miles for water. In contrast, parts of India face seasonal scarcity during dry months, despite abundant monsoons, because of inadequate storage systems. Wealthier nations like Australia also grapple with drought, though advanced infrastructure mitigates the impact compared to poorer regions.<br><br>(5) Addressing water scarcity requires innovative solutions and global cooperation. Efforts to improve water management, such as recycling wastewater or adopting efficient irrigation, show promise in regions willing to invest. International organizations push for policies to protect resources, but progress is slow. The vision of equitable water access remains elusive, especially in the hardest-hit areas, where survival hinges on every drop.",
