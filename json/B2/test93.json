  "passage": "<br>(1) Urban sprawl, the uncontrolled expansion of cities into surrounding rural areas, has become a defining feature of modern development. Driven by population growth, economic opportunities, and the desire for larger living spaces, this phenomenon reshapes landscapes worldwide. Cities like Los Angeles and Mumbai exemplify how urban boundaries stretch outward, converting farmland and forests into residential zones, commercial hubs, and infrastructure. While this growth meets human needs, it raises concerns about its long-term effects on ecosystems and sustainability.<br><br>(2) The patterns of urban sprawl vary across regions, influenced by geography, policy, and culture. In North America, low-density suburbs with single-family homes dominate, facilitated by widespread car use and highway systems. In contrast, some European cities expand more compactly, guided by stricter zoning laws that aim to preserve green spaces. However, in developing nations, rapid and often unplanned sprawl leads to informal settlements, where access to services like water and electricity remains limited, amplifying social and environmental challenges.<br><br>(3) One major environmental impact of urban sprawl is the loss of natural habitats. As cities encroach on forests and wetlands, wildlife populations decline, and biodiversity suffers. The replacement of vegetation with concrete also disrupts water cycles, increasing runoff and the risk of flooding in urban areas. Studies estimate that sprawling cities consume land at a rate far exceeding population growth, highlighting the inefficiency of this development model and its toll on the planet.<br><br>(4) Air quality and climate change are further strained by urban sprawl. The reliance on cars in sprawling suburbs generates higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to compact urban centers with efficient public transit. Sprawling cities also contribute to the 'urban heat island' effect, where asphalt and buildings trap heat, raising local temperatures. These factors not only degrade living conditions but also challenge efforts to combat global warming, prompting calls for smarter urban planning.<br><br>(5) Addressing urban sprawl requires balancing growth with environmental care. Some cities adopt 'smart growth' strategies, promoting higher-density housing, mixed-use developments, and green belts to limit outward expansion. Others invest in public transportation to reduce car dependency and preserve rural land. While these measures show promise, their success depends on coordinated policies, public support, and innovation. As urban sprawl continues to shape the world, its environmental impacts underscore the urgent need for sustainable solutions.",
