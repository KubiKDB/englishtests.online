  "passage": "<br>(1) Nationalism, a political ideology that emerged prominently in 19th century Europe, fundamentally reshaped the continent's political and cultural landscape. The concept centered on the belief that people sharing a common language, history, and cultural traditions should form a unified, sovereign state. This principle challenged the existing political order of multinational empires like the Austrian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires, which had dominated European politics for centuries. The nationalist movements were often inspired by Romantic ideals that celebrated folk traditions, local languages, and cultural heritage.<br><br>(2) The early 19th century saw nationalism initially intertwined with liberalism, as advocates for national self-determination frequently championed constitutional government and expanded civil liberties. The Greek War of Independence (1821-1832) marked one of the first successful nationalist movements, gaining support from Western Europeans sympathetic to the idea of restoring the glory of ancient Greece. Similarly, the revolutions of 1848, though largely unsuccessful in the short term, spread nationalist sentiments across central and eastern Europe, igniting aspirations for independence among many ethnic groups.<br><br>(3) In central Europe, nationalism manifested differently in Italy and Germany, leading to processes of unification that dramatically altered the European balance of power. Italian unification, or the Risorgimento, culminated in 1861 under the leadership of figures like Giuseppe Garibaldi and Count Camillo di Cavour. German unification, achieved through the diplomatic maneuvering of Otto von Bismarck and three strategic wars, resulted in the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871. These newly unified nations shifted significant power away from the traditional diplomatic centers of Vienna and Paris.<br><br>(4) As the century progressed, nationalism increasingly took on more exclusive and aggressive forms. What began as a liberating philosophy often transformed into a force for asserting dominance over minority groups within national boundaries. In multinational regions like the Balkans, competing nationalist claims created enduring tensions that would eventually contribute to broader European conflicts. By the late 19th century, nationalism had become closely associated with imperialist ambitions, as European powers justified colonial expansion as an extension of national greatness and destiny.<br><br>(5) The legacy of 19th-century nationalism proved profoundly ambiguous. While it dismantled outdated political structures and empowered many previously marginalized groups to achieve self-governance, it also sowed seeds of division and conflict. The complex ethnic patchwork of central and eastern Europe made the nationalist ideal of clear nation-state boundaries practically unattainable without population displacement or oppression. Ultimately, the nationalist movements of the 19th century reshaped Europe's political map and established ideological patterns that would continue to influence global politics well into the 20th and 21st centuries.",
