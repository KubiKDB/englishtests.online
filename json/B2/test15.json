  "passage": "<br>(1) Geoengineering, the deliberate manipulation of Earth’s climate systems, has emerged as a controversial response to global warming. As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, some scientists argue that traditional mitigation efforts, like reducing carbon footprints, may not suffice. Geoengineering offers radical solutions, such as injecting aerosols into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight or fertilizing oceans to boost carbon-absorbing algae. While these methods could theoretically cool the planet, they raise profound ethical and practical questions.<br><br>(2) One prominent geoengineering technique is solar radiation management (SRM). By dispersing reflective particles into the atmosphere, SRM aims to mimic the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions. Research suggests it could lower global temperatures within months, providing a rapid counter to climate change. However, critics warn of unintended consequences, such as altered rainfall patterns that might disrupt agriculture in vulnerable regions like South Asia or sub-Saharan Africa.<br><br>(3) Another approach involves carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which seeks to extract excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Techniques include planting vast forests, enhancing soil carbon storage, or deploying machines to capture carbon directly from the air. While CDR addresses the root cause of warming, it is slower and more expensive than SRM. Moreover, scaling these methods to a global level poses logistical challenges and requires massive investment.<br><br>(4) The risks of geoengineering are as significant as its potential. Altering the climate could trigger ecological imbalances, such as ocean acidification or biodiversity loss. There’s also the danger of geopolitical tension—nations might disagree on how, when, or whether to deploy these technologies. Some fear that geoengineering could weaken commitments to reducing emissions, treating it as a quick fix rather than a supplement to sustainable practices.<br><br>(5) Ultimately, geoengineering remains a polarizing topic. Proponents see it as a necessary tool to buy time while decarbonization efforts mature, but opponents argue it’s a reckless gamble with an already fragile planet. International governance is critical to manage its development, ensuring risks are weighed against benefits. As research advances, society must decide whether human intervention in climate systems is a bold innovation or a step too far.",
