  "passage": "<br>(1) The world's oceans cover approximately 71% of Earth's surface and play a crucial role in regulating global climate patterns. These vast bodies of water act as enormous heat reservoirs, absorbing solar radiation and storing it more effectively than land. This thermal capacity allows oceans to moderate temperature extremes, creating more stable climate conditions in coastal regions compared to inland areas at similar latitudes. The temperature difference between water and land also drives atmospheric circulation patterns that distribute heat and moisture around the planet, influencing weather systems on both local and global scales.<br><br>(2) Ocean currents serve as the planet's climate conveyor belts, transporting warm water from tropical regions toward the poles and cold water from polar regions toward the equator. The Gulf Stream, perhaps the most famous of these currents, carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic Ocean to Western Europe. This current alone is responsible for keeping parts of Northern Europe significantly warmer than other regions at similar latitudes. For instance, the city of Oslo in Norway experiences much milder winters than locations in Alaska or Canada that lie at the same distance from the equator, demonstrating the profound impact ocean currents have on regional climates.<br><br>(3) Beyond temperature regulation, oceans critically influence precipitation patterns worldwide. The process of evaporation from ocean surfaces provides approximately 86% of the Earth's atmospheric moisture, which eventually falls as rain or snow. Phenomena such as El Niño and La Niña—cyclical changes in Pacific Ocean temperatures—dramatically alter global precipitation patterns, causing droughts in some regions while triggering floods in others. These fluctuations in ocean temperatures can lead to devastating consequences for agriculture, water supplies, and ecosystems across continents, highlighting the interconnectedness of oceanic and atmospheric systems.<br><br>(4) The oceans also play a vital role in carbon sequestration, absorbing approximately 30% of human-produced carbon dioxide emissions. This carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, forming carbonic acid and eventually becoming incorporated into marine organisms or sediments. However, this absorption comes at a cost: increasing carbon dioxide levels are leading to ocean acidification, threatening marine ecosystems and potentially altering ocean circulation patterns. Changes in these circulation patterns could significantly disrupt the climate regulation services that oceans provide, potentially accelerating global climate change.<br><br>(5) As climate change progresses, marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent and intense, disrupting established ocean temperature patterns. These shifts affect not only marine life but also weather patterns on land. Rising sea levels, another consequence of warming oceans, threaten coastal communities and ecosystems worldwide. Understanding the complex relationship between oceans and climate is therefore crucial for predicting future climate scenarios and developing effective adaptation strategies. The oceans' influence extends far beyond their shores, making their health and stability essential components of global climate resilience.",
