  "passage": "<br>(1) The Roman civilization, spanning roughly from 500 BCE to 500 CE, stands as a cornerstone of human history. Beginning in the Italian peninsula, Rome grew into a powerful empire that stretched across Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia. Its enduring influence is seen in fields like engineering, governance, and culture, shaping societies long after its decline.<br><br>(2) Life in ancient Rome varied greatly depending on social class. The patricians, a small group of wealthy landowners, dominated politics and enjoyed luxuries, while the plebeians, the working majority, lived simpler lives as farmers, artisans, or laborers. Family was the backbone of Roman society, led by the paterfamilias, who held authority over his household. Public entertainment, such as gladiator fights and chariot races, united all classes in shared enjoyment.<br><br>(3) Roman innovations in engineering and architecture were revolutionary. They mastered concrete, building lasting structures like the Colosseum and expansive aqueducts that supplied water to cities. Their use of arches and domes allowed for grand temples and public baths, while a vast road network connected the empire, boosting trade and military efficiency.<br><br>(4) Beyond construction, Rome's contributions to law and language were profound. The Twelve Tables established early legal principles, later expanded into the Corpus Juris Civilis, influencing modern justice systems. Latin, Rome's language, gave rise to the Romance languages and enriched scientific vocabulary. Writers like Virgil and Cicero left literary works that remain studied today.<br><br>(5) Rome's legacy echoes in today's world. Its republican government inspired democratic ideals, while its architectural techniques influence modern design. Infrastructure like roads and sanitation systems set urban planning standards. The adoption of Christianity in Rome's later years also shaped global religion and culture, cementing its historical impact.",
