  "passage": "<br>(1) The Aztec Empire emerged as a dominant power in Mesoamerica during the 15th and early 16th centuries, creating one of the most sophisticated civilizations in the pre-Columbian Americas. Founded in 1428 through a triple alliance of city-states—Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan—the empire rapidly expanded through military conquest and strategic political alliances. At its height, the Aztec domain encompassed much of central Mexico, with its capital Tenochtitlan (modern-day Mexico City) serving as the political and ceremonial heart of their civilization, impressively built on an island in Lake Texcoco.<br><br>(2) Aztec society was highly structured and hierarchical, with distinct social classes that included nobles (pipiltin), commoners (macehualtin), serfs, and slaves. Political authority was centered on the emperor, or huey tlatoani (\"great speaker\"), who ruled with both secular and religious power. The empire's sophisticated administrative system included provincial governors, tax collectors, and judges who maintained order across their territories. Education was mandatory for all children regardless of social class, though noble children received more extensive training in specialized schools called calmecac, where they studied history, religion, astronomy, and the arts.<br><br>(3) The Aztec economy thrived on a complex agricultural system that featured chinampas—raised farming beds constructed in shallow lake beds that yielded multiple harvests annually. Their extensive trade networks facilitated the exchange of goods such as textiles, pottery, obsidian tools, and luxury items throughout Mesoamerica. Markets were central to Aztec life, with the main marketplace at Tlatelolco accommodating up to 60,000 people daily. The empire collected tribute from conquered territories, which formed a significant portion of their wealth and resources, including food, textiles, precious metals, and other valuable commodities.<br><br>(4) Religion permeated every aspect of Aztec culture, with a sophisticated pantheon of deities governing natural forces and human activities. Their cosmology divided the universe into multiple planes connected through ritual, with the material world existing as just one component of reality. The controversial practice of human sacrifice, while often emphasized in historical accounts, was embedded within a complex religious framework that viewed blood offerings as necessary to sustain the cosmos and nourish the gods. Alongside these dramatic rituals existed rich artistic traditions in sculpture, poetry, music, and dance that reflected both religious devotion and aesthetic sophistication.<br><br>(5) The Aztec Empire's decline began with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors led by Hernán Cortés in 1519. Taking advantage of existing political tensions, Cortés formed alliances with the Aztecs' enemies, particularly the Tlaxcalans, who had long resisted imperial control. The Spanish also benefited from the devastating impact of introduced diseases like smallpox, which decimated indigenous populations lacking immunity. In 1521, after a brutal siege of Tenochtitlan, the Spanish and their indigenous allies toppled the empire, marking the beginning of Spanish colonial rule. Though militarily defeated, Aztec cultural influence persisted, forming an essential element of Mexico's modern cultural identity and historical consciousness.",
