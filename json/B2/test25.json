  "passage": "<br>(1) Earthquake engineering has emerged as a critical field, focusing on designing structures that can endure the destructive forces of seismic activity. In regions prone to earthquakes, such as Japan and California, engineers have pioneered techniques to protect buildings, bridges, and infrastructure. These innovations include flexible materials, advanced dampers, and base isolation systems that absorb and redirect seismic energy. The goal is to minimize damage and ensure safety, even during powerful tremors.<br><br>(2) One key advancement is the use of base isolation, a method where buildings rest on flexible pads or bearings. This setup allows a structure to move independently from the shaking ground, reducing the impact of vibrations. For example, the San Francisco City Hall was retrofitted with this technology, enabling it to withstand significant quakes. Such systems are now standard in many high-risk areas, offering a practical solution to an age-old problem.<br><br>(3) Another approach involves the integration of smart materials and sensors into structural design. These materials can adapt to stress, while sensors monitor a building’s response to seismic waves in real time. Engineers use this data to assess stability and predict potential weaknesses. Although costly, this technology has proven effective in modern skyscrapers, where height and weight amplify the challenges posed by earthquakes.<br><br>(4) Despite these advances, challenges remain in making earthquake-resistant designs accessible globally. In developing countries, limited resources and outdated construction practices hinder progress. Retrofitting older buildings is also a slow and expensive process, often requiring government support. Engineers argue that investing in prevention saves lives and reduces long-term costs, yet funding remains a persistent barrier in many regions.<br><br>(5) Looking forward, the field of earthquake engineering continues to evolve with new ideas and collaborations. Researchers are exploring lightweight, durable materials and computer simulations to test designs under extreme conditions. International partnerships also play a role, sharing knowledge to improve standards worldwide. As seismic risks grow with urbanization, these innovations offer hope for safer, more resilient communities in the face of nature’s unpredictable forces.",
