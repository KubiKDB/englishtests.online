  "passage": "<br>(1) Democracy, from the Greek words 'demos' (people) and 'kratos' (rule), has undergone a remarkable evolution throughout human history. The earliest democratic practices emerged in ancient Athens around 508 BCE, where eligible citizens gathered in the Ekklesia to debate policy, pass laws, and elect officials. However, this participation was limited to adult male citizens, excluding women, slaves, and foreigners â€“ a stark contrast to today's more inclusive democratic systems.<br><br>(2) During the Middle Ages, democratic principles were largely overshadowed by feudal and monarchical systems, though limited forms of representative governance existed in institutions like England's Parliament, established in 1215 following the Magna Carta. The Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries sparked renewed interest in democratic ideals, with philosophers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau advocating for social contracts and popular sovereignty, directly influencing the American and French Revolutions.<br><br>(3) The 19th century witnessed substantial democratic expansion, as numerous nations abolished property requirements for voting. Nevertheless, universal suffrage remained elusive, with women and minorities frequently excluded from the democratic process. New Zealand made history in 1893 by becoming the first self-governing nation to grant women the right to vote, while the United States only achieved this milestone in 1920 through the 19th Amendment. Countries like Switzerland delayed women's suffrage until as late as 1971, demonstrating the uneven pace of democratic progress.<br><br>(4) The 20th century saw democracy's greatest expansion, particularly following World War II and later after the Cold War's conclusion. The collapse of colonial empires and the Soviet bloc led to democratic transitions across Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. International organizations like the United Nations emerged to promote democratic values globally, while technological advancements enabled new forms of democratic participation. However, this period also revealed democracy's vulnerabilities through episodes of backsliding and authoritarianism.<br><br>(5) Today's democratic systems exhibit tremendous diversity, ranging from direct democracy in Swiss cantons to representative systems in larger nations, and from parliamentary to presidential frameworks. Digital technology has introduced both opportunities and challenges for democratic governance, enabling greater civic participation while simultaneously facilitating misinformation and polarization. Contemporary democracy continues to evolve through ongoing experimentation with deliberative democracy, participatory budgeting, and various electoral reforms, reflecting humanity's persistent quest for more effective and inclusive systems of self-governance.",
