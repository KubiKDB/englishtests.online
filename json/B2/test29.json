  "passage": "<br>(1) The majestic mountains that dominate Earth's landscapes represent some of the most dramatic evidence of our planet's dynamic nature. These imposing features, which can reach heights of several kilometers above sea level, are primarily the result of plate tectonics—the scientific theory that explains how Earth's outermost layer is divided into several plates that glide over the mantle, the rocky inner layer above the core. This revolutionary concept, only widely accepted in the scientific community since the 1960s, helps us understand not only mountain formation but also earthquakes, volcanoes, and the very shape of our continents and ocean basins.<br><br>(2) The most common type of mountain formation occurs at convergent plate boundaries, where two tectonic plates move toward each other. When oceanic and continental plates collide, the denser oceanic plate typically slides beneath the lighter continental plate in a process called subduction. This process generates magma that rises to form volcanic mountain ranges, such as the Andes in South America. Alternatively, when two continental plates collide, neither can subduct fully due to their similar densities. Instead, the enormous pressure forces the land to fold and thrust upward, creating mountain ranges like the Himalayas, which continue to grow taller by several millimeters each year as the Indian subcontinent presses into Asia.<br><br>(3) Mountains can also form at divergent boundaries, where tectonic plates move away from each other. As plates separate, magma rises from the mantle to fill the gap, creating new crust. This process primarily occurs along mid-ocean ridges, forming submarine mountain ranges like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Less commonly, divergent boundaries can form within continents, creating rift valleys flanked by mountains, as seen in East Africa. A third type of formation happens at transform boundaries, where plates slide horizontally past each other, sometimes creating pressure ridges or uplifted blocks that form more modest mountain features.<br><br>(4) Beyond plate boundaries, mountains can also form through other geological processes. Hot spots, where plumes of magma rise from deep within the mantle, can create volcanic mountains even in the middle of tectonic plates. The Hawaiian Islands formed this way, as the Pacific Plate moved over a relatively stationary hot spot, creating a chain of increasingly older islands and seamounts. Erosion-resistant rock formations can also become mountains through a process called differential erosion, where surrounding softer rocks wear away over millions of years, leaving harder formations standing as isolated mountains.<br><br>(5) The study of mountain formation reveals much about Earth's past and offers insights into its future. By examining rock layers in mountains, geologists can reconstruct ancient environments and climate conditions that existed millions of years ago. Mountain ranges also significantly influence global climate patterns by affecting atmospheric circulation and precipitation. As human activities continue to impact Earth's systems, understanding these massive geological features and the processes that create them becomes increasingly important for predicting how our planet might respond to changes in the future.",
