  "passage": "<br>(1) Glacial retreat, the shrinking of glaciers due to melting, has accelerated in recent decades, reshaping landscapes and raising global concerns. This phenomenon is primarily driven by climate change, as rising temperatures from greenhouse gas emissions cause ice to melt faster than it can accumulate. Glaciers in regions like the Alps, Himalayas, and Greenland are losing mass at alarming rates, altering river systems and coastal environments. Scientists view this trend as a clear indicator of a warming planet and its cascading effects on nature and humanity.<br><br>(2) The causes of glacial retreat are rooted in both natural and human-induced factors. Historically, glaciers have advanced and receded with shifts in Earth’s climate, but today’s rapid melting is largely tied to industrial activity. Burning fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, trapping heat and raising global temperatures. Deforestation and other land-use changes further amplify this warming, reducing the planet’s ability to reflect sunlight. As a result, glaciers that once persisted for centuries are now vanishing within decades.<br><br>(3) One immediate consequence of glacial retreat is its impact on water supplies. Glaciers act as natural reservoirs, storing freshwater and releasing it gradually into rivers and streams. In areas like the Andes and Central Asia, millions depend on this meltwater for drinking, irrigation, and hydropower. As glaciers shrink, these regions face seasonal shortages, threatening agriculture and energy production. Over time, the loss of this reliable water source could destabilize entire communities.<br><br>(4) Beyond water, glacial retreat contributes to rising sea levels and ecological disruption. Melting ice from Greenland and Antarctica adds significant volumes of water to the oceans, endangering low-lying coastal areas with flooding. The retreat also exposes barren land, altering habitats and reducing biodiversity as species struggle to adapt. In polar regions, the loss of ice affects animals like polar bears and seals, whose survival depends on stable ice platforms.<br><br>(5) Addressing glacial retreat demands urgent action and long-term strategies. Reducing carbon emissions through renewable energy and conservation efforts can slow the warming driving this meltdown. Meanwhile, communities are adapting by improving water management and building infrastructure to cope with changing conditions. Scientists continue to monitor glaciers with advanced tools, hoping to predict future impacts. As glacial retreat reshapes the planet, it underscores the need for global cooperation to mitigate its far-reaching consequences.",
