  "passage": "<br>(1) Ocean acidification, a process driven by rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, is altering the chemistry of the world’s oceans at an unprecedented rate. As CO2 dissolves into seawater, it forms carbonic acid, lowering the ocean’s pH and making it more acidic. This shift poses a significant threat to marine ecosystems, particularly to organisms like corals, shellfish, and plankton that rely on calcium carbonate to build their skeletons and shells. Scientists warn that these changes could disrupt food chains and biodiversity in ways we are only beginning to understand.<br><br>(2) Coral reefs, often called the 'rainforests of the sea,' are among the most vulnerable to ocean acidification. The increased acidity weakens their ability to form calcium carbonate structures, leading to slower growth or even dissolution. This degradation not only affects the corals themselves but also the countless species that depend on reefs for shelter and breeding grounds. Researchers estimate that if current trends continue, many reefs could vanish within decades, leaving coastal communities without natural barriers against storms.<br><br>(3) Shellfish, such as oysters and clams, also face challenges as acidification impairs their shell-building process. Studies show that juvenile shellfish are especially sensitive, often failing to survive in waters with lower pH levels. This decline has economic implications, particularly for industries like aquaculture that depend on healthy shellfish populations. In some regions, fishers have already noticed smaller yields, raising concerns about food security and livelihoods.<br><br>(4) Beyond reefs and shellfish, ocean acidification affects the broader marine food web. Plankton, a foundational species, struggles to adapt to changing conditions, which in turn impacts fish and marine mammals higher up the chain. Some species may evolve over time, but the rapid pace of acidification leaves little room for adaptation. Scientists are investigating how these shifts might alter predator-prey relationships and ecosystem stability.<br><br>(5) Efforts to address ocean acidification include reducing global CO2 emissions and exploring local solutions like seaweed farming, which can absorb excess carbon. However, reversing the damage requires international cooperation and long-term commitment. As research deepens, experts emphasize the need for public awareness and policy action to protect marine life from this silent but growing crisis.",
