  "passage": "<br>(1) The Industrial Revolution, which began in Britain in the late 18th century and spread throughout Europe and North America in the 19th century, marked a pivotal transition in human history. Prior to this transformation, most people lived in rural communities, working primarily in agriculture or small-scale manufacturing conducted in homes. The advent of mechanized production systems fundamentally altered not only how goods were produced but also how societies were structured, creating ripple effects that continue to influence our modern world.<br><br>(2) At the heart of the Industrial Revolution was a series of technological innovations that dramatically increased production efficiency. The development of the steam engine by James Watt in 1769 provided a powerful new energy source that could drive machinery in factories, power locomotives, and propel ships. Textile innovations like the spinning jenny, water frame, and power loom mechanized cloth production, enabling manufacturers to produce fabrics at unprecedented speed and scale. Later advances in iron production, chemical manufacturing, and electricity further accelerated industrial development, creating entirely new industries and opportunities.<br><br>(3) These technological changes led to profound economic transformations. The factory system emerged as the dominant mode of production, with workers congregating in centralized locations rather than producing goods in their homes. This shift increased productivity tremendously but also created new class divisions between factory owners and wage laborers. Economic growth accelerated dramatically, with industrial output increasing exponentially compared to pre-industrial times. International trade expanded as nations specialized in specific industrial goods and sought new markets and raw materials, laying the groundwork for modern global economic systems.<br><br>(4) Society underwent equally dramatic changes as populations shifted from rural areas to rapidly growing urban centers near factories. Cities expanded at unprecedented rates, often without adequate housing, sanitation, or infrastructure, creating serious social problems. Working conditions in early factories were frequently harsh, with long hours, dangerous machinery, and minimal safety regulations. These conditions eventually gave rise to labor movements and calls for reform. Simultaneously, a growing middle class emerged, consisting of professionals, managers, and business owners who benefited from industrial expansion without facing the hardships of factory work.<br><br>(5) The legacy of the Industrial Revolution extends far beyond economics and technology. It fundamentally altered humanity's relationship with the natural environment, initiating large-scale resource extraction and environmental pollution that continues today. It transformed family structures and gender roles as work increasingly took place outside the home. Educational systems evolved to meet the needs of industrialized societies, emphasizing literacy, technical knowledge, and specialized skills. Perhaps most significantly, industrialization established patterns of technological innovation and economic growth that continue to drive societal change in our increasingly interconnected global civilization.",
