  "passage": "<br>(1) The American Civil War, fought between 1861 and 1865, was a defining moment in U.S. history. It involved the Northern states, called the Union, and the Southern states, which seceded to form the Confederacy. The war emerged from disputes over slavery, states’ rights, and economic differences between the two regions.<br><br>(2) The tensions had been building since the nation’s early years. The South’s economy depended heavily on agriculture, particularly cotton, which relied on enslaved labor. Meanwhile, the North embraced industrialization and increasingly supported abolishing slavery. Efforts to bridge these gaps through political agreements failed, deepening the divide.<br><br>(3) The conflict escalated with key events. In 1860, Abraham Lincoln’s election as president alarmed the South, leading seven states to secede even before he took office. The war officially began in April 1861 when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter. Major battles, such as Gettysburg in 1863 and Antietam in 1862, marked turning points, with the Union gradually overpowering the Confederacy.<br><br>(4) The war’s end in 1865 brought significant changes. The Union was preserved, and slavery was abolished with the 13th Amendment. However, the South faced devastation—its cities and farms destroyed, its economy crippled. With over 600,000 deaths, the Civil War remains the deadliest conflict in American history, leaving deep scars on the nation.<br><br>(5) The Civil War’s impact endures today. It strengthened federal authority and set the stage for civil rights progress, though equality remained elusive during the Reconstruction era and beyond. Monuments and debates about the war still spark discussion, reflecting its role in shaping national identity and the ongoing quest for justice.",
