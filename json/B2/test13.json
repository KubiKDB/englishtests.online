  "passage": "<br>(1) Extreme weather phenomena, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and blizzards, have become more frequent and intense in recent decades, prompting scientists to investigate their causes and consequences. These events are driven by complex interactions between atmospheric conditions, ocean temperatures, and human activity. Rising global temperatures, largely due to greenhouse gas emissions, amplify the energy available for storms, leading to stronger winds and heavier rainfall. Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of such disasters on communities worldwide.<br><br>(2) Hurricanes, for instance, form over warm ocean waters where heat and moisture fuel their development. As sea surface temperatures increase, these storms gain strength, often resulting in devastating floods and wind damage when they make landfall. In 2020, the Atlantic hurricane season broke records with 30 named storms, a trend scientists attribute to climate change. This escalation highlights the need for improved forecasting and infrastructure to withstand such powerful forces of nature.<br><br>(3) Tornadoes, though smaller in scale, pose equally severe risks due to their unpredictable paths and destructive winds. These swirling columns of air emerge from thunderstorms, particularly in regions like the central United States, known as 'Tornado Alley.' Warmer air and shifting weather patterns may be extending the range and season of tornado activity, challenging emergency preparedness efforts. The suddenness of these events leaves little time for evacuation, making early warning systems vital.<br><br>(4) Beyond immediate destruction, extreme weather has far-reaching effects on economies and ecosystems. Floods from storms can ruin crops, disrupt supply chains, and displace populations, while prolonged droughts—another extreme phenomenon—threaten water supplies and agriculture. Coastal areas face rising sea levels, exacerbating storm surges and erosion. These cascading impacts strain resources and force governments to rethink urban planning and disaster response strategies to protect vulnerable regions.<br><br>(5) Addressing extreme weather requires both global and local action. Reducing carbon emissions remains a key strategy to slow the warming that intensifies these events, yet adaptation is equally essential. Communities are adopting resilient designs, such as elevated buildings and flood barriers, alongside advanced technologies like satellite monitoring to track storms. As extreme weather continues to test human ingenuity, collaboration across nations and disciplines offers the best hope for minimizing its toll on society and the environment.",
