  "passage": "<br>(1) The French Revolution, which erupted in 1789, was the culmination of decades of social and political tension in France. The monarchy, led by King Louis XVI, faced financial crisis due to involvement in costly wars and lavish spending, while the majority of the population struggled with high taxes and food shortages. The rigid social hierarchy, divided into three estates—clergy, nobility, and commoners—created deep resentment as the privileged minority enjoyed exemption from taxation while the burdened third estate, comprising 97% of the population, had no political voice despite contributing most of the state's revenue.<br><br>(2) The revolution began with the formation of the National Assembly and the famous Tennis Court Oath, where representatives pledged not to disband until France had a new constitution. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, became a powerful symbol of popular uprising against royal authority. As revolutionary fervor spread across France, peasants revolted against feudal obligations in what became known as the Great Fear. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was adopted in August 1789, proclaiming equality and liberty as universal rights and establishing citizenship as the foundation of political legitimacy.<br><br>(3) The revolution soon entered a more radical phase. The monarchy was abolished in 1792, and King Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. The revolutionary government, facing internal rebellion and external threats from European monarchies, instituted the Reign of Terror under Maximilien Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety. This period witnessed mass executions via the guillotine, with thousands suspected of counter-revolutionary activities put to death. The Terror finally ended with Robespierre's own execution in July 1794, paving the way for a more moderate government known as the Directory.<br><br>(4) Napoleon Bonaparte's rise to power in 1799 marked the end of the revolutionary period, though many revolutionary principles continued under his rule. He consolidated several key revolutionary reforms, including a centralized administration, the Civil Code (Napoleon Code), and a merit-based system in education and government service. While Napoleon eventually crowned himself emperor, betraying republican ideals, he nevertheless preserved and exported many revolutionary principles throughout Europe during his military campaigns.<br><br>(5) The long-term legacy of the French Revolution has been profound and global. It fundamentally transformed the concept of citizenship, challenged the divine right of kings, and inspired subsequent revolutions worldwide. The ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity became powerful political forces that continue to influence modern democracies. The revolution also contributed to the development of modern nationalism and the concept of the nation-state. Despite its violent excesses, the French Revolution represents a pivotal moment in human history, marking the transition from ancient regime monarchies toward modern democratic governance and universal human rights.",
