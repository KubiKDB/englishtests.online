  "passage": "<br>(1) Decolonization movements of the 20th century represent one of the most significant political transformations in modern history. Following centuries of European imperial dominance across Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean, the decades after World War II witnessed a dramatic shift as colonized peoples mobilized to demand independence and self-determination. These movements emerged from complex historical conditions, including the weakening of European powers after two devastating world wars, the rise of nationalist sentiments among colonized populations, and growing international pressure against colonial rule. The United Nations, established in 1945, provided a global platform that increasingly recognized the right of all peoples to determine their own political futures.<br><br>(2) African decolonization unfolded with remarkable speed during the 1950s and 1960s, often called the 'Wind of Change' era. Ghana's independence in 1957, under the leadership of Kwame Nkrumah, inspired numerous liberation struggles across the continent. By 1966, over 30 African nations had achieved independence. While some territories gained freedom through negotiation, others faced violent resistance from colonial powers. Algeria's war for independence (1954-1962) against France claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, while Kenya's Mau Mau uprising against British rule led to thousands of casualties before independence was achieved in 1963. These struggles reflected the determination of colonized peoples to secure political autonomy despite tremendous costs.<br><br>(3) In Asia, the trajectory of decolonization began earlier but followed diverse paths. India's independence movement, led by Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violent resistance, culminated in freedom from British rule in 1947, though it came with the painful partition into India and Pakistan. Indonesia declared independence from the Netherlands in 1945, but full recognition came only after four years of armed conflict. Vietnam's struggle extended over decades, first against French colonial control until 1954, then against American intervention until 1975. These movements often intertwined with ideological battles of the Cold War, as newly independent nations navigated between competing Soviet and American influences.<br><br>(4) The Caribbean and Pacific regions experienced later waves of decolonization, with most territories gaining independence in the 1960s through 1980s. Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago achieved independence from Britain in 1962, while smaller islands followed later. The process often involved careful negotiation of post-colonial relationships, including considerations of economic dependency, defense agreements, and migration pathways. Some territories chose alternative arrangements to full independence, such as free association or continued integration with former colonial powers, reflecting the complex realities of small island states in the global economy.<br><br>(5) The legacy of decolonization movements extends far beyond the formal transfer of political power. Newly independent nations faced immense challenges in building national identity, establishing functioning institutions, and developing economic systems often shaped by colonial extraction. Many countries struggled with artificial boundaries drawn by colonial powers, leading to ethnic tensions and civil conflicts. Nevertheless, decolonization transformed global politics by establishing the principle of national self-determination and creating dozens of new voices in international forums. The Non-Aligned Movement, formed in 1961, represented an attempt by formerly colonized nations to chart an independent course in international relations, separate from Cold War power blocs, and continues to influence global governance debates to this day.",
