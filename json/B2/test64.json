  "passage": "<br>(1) Antibiotic resistance has emerged as one of the most pressing global health challenges of the 21st century. When antibiotics were first discovered in the 1940s, they revolutionized medicine by providing effective treatments for previously deadly infections. However, over decades of use, many bacteria have evolved to withstand the effects of these once-powerful drugs, creating what health officials now call 'superbugs' – bacteria that cannot be killed by multiple types of antibiotics.<br><br>(2) Several factors have contributed to this growing crisis. The most significant cause is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in both human healthcare and agriculture. Many patients receive antibiotics for viral infections like colds and flu, against which these drugs have no effect. Meanwhile, in many countries, antibiotics are routinely added to animal feed to promote growth and prevent disease in livestock, creating perfect conditions for resistant bacteria to develop and spread.<br><br>(3) The consequences of antibiotic resistance are already evident worldwide. Common infections that were once easily treatable now require stronger medications, longer hospital stays, or may not respond to treatment at all. Medical procedures that rely on antibiotics to prevent infection – such as surgeries and cancer treatments – become significantly more dangerous when these drugs lose effectiveness. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2050, drug-resistant infections could claim 10 million lives annually if current trends continue.<br><br>(4) Addressing this crisis requires a coordinated global response across multiple sectors. Healthcare providers must improve antibiotic stewardship by prescribing these medications only when necessary and ensuring patients complete their full course of treatment. Agricultural practices need reform to eliminate the routine use of antibiotics in healthy animals. Pharmaceutical companies require incentives to develop new antibiotics, as the current market provides limited financial return on these investments.<br><br>(5) Perhaps most importantly, public awareness and education about antibiotic resistance must increase. Many people still believe antibiotics should be taken for any infection, unaware of the potential harm of inappropriate use. By understanding that antibiotics are precious resources that must be preserved, individuals can make better healthcare decisions and support policies that protect these vital medicines for future generations. Only through combined efforts at individual, community, and global levels can we hope to slow the advance of antibiotic resistance and maintain the effectiveness of these life-saving drugs.",
