  "passage": "<br>(1) The Amazon rainforest, often called the \"lungs of the Earth,\" is a massive ecosystem stretching across nine South American countries. Spanning over 5.5 million square kilometers, it contains approximately 390 billion trees and an incredible variety of plants and animals. This vast forest significantly influences global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, helping to combat climate change.<br><br>(2) The Amazon’s biodiversity is unparalleled. Scientists estimate it harbors about 10% of the planet’s known species, including over 2.5 million types of insects, 2,000 bird species, and numerous mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Well-known creatures like jaguars, sloths, and pink river dolphins thrive here. The forest also supports indigenous communities that have coexisted with nature for millennia.<br><br>(3) Despite its importance, the Amazon faces serious threats. Deforestation, driven by agriculture, logging, and mining, destroys large swathes of the forest annually. Recent statistics show an alarming rise in deforestation rates, endangering wildlife and indigenous livelihoods while releasing stored carbon, which worsens climate change.<br><br>(4) Conservation efforts are underway to safeguard the Amazon. Governments and organizations are creating protected zones, encouraging sustainable practices, and reinforcing indigenous land rights. Global collaboration is vital since the forest’s condition impacts the entire world. Programs like the Amazon Fund collect funds for conservation and sustainable projects.<br><br>(5) There remains hope for the Amazon’s future. Technological advancements, such as satellite monitoring, enhance efforts to curb illegal deforestation. Increasing worldwide recognition of the forest’s value has spurred greater support for its preservation. Collective action could ensure the Amazon endures for future generations.",
