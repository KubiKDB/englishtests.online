  "passage": "<br>(1) Urban heat islands (UHIs) describe a phenomenon where cities experience higher temperatures than their rural surroundings. This microclimate effect arises from human activity and urban design, trapping heat in densely built environments. Factors like concrete buildings, asphalt roads, and limited greenery absorb and retain solar energy, pushing city temperatures up by as much as 5-10°C compared to nearby rural areas. As urbanization accelerates, understanding UHIs becomes critical for addressing their environmental and social impacts.<br><br>(2) The primary driver of UHIs is the replacement of natural landscapes with heat-absorbing materials. Rural areas benefit from vegetation that cools through evapotranspiration—plants release water vapor, reducing surface heat. In contrast, cities favor dark surfaces like pavement, which soak up sunlight and radiate heat long after sunset. Additionally, tall buildings block wind, limiting natural ventilation that could disperse this trapped warmth.<br><br>(3) Human activity amplifies UHIs further. Cars, air conditioners, and industrial processes release waste heat, adding to the thermal load. During summer, air conditioning use spikes as residents combat rising indoor temperatures, ironically generating more outdoor heat. Studies show that in megacities like Tokyo or New York, this anthropogenic heat can account for up to 30% of the UHI effect, creating a feedback loop of warming.<br><br>(4) The consequences of UHIs extend beyond discomfort. Higher temperatures increase energy demand for cooling, straining power grids and raising greenhouse gas emissions. Urban dwellers also face health risks, such as heatstroke, especially during heatwaves when night-time cooling is insufficient. Moreover, UHIs disrupt local ecosystems—warmer conditions can alter plant growth cycles and push wildlife out of city borders, reducing biodiversity.<br><br>(5) Mitigating UHIs requires innovative urban planning. Cities are experimenting with green roofs, reflective pavements, and expanded tree cover to counteract heat retention. For instance, planting urban forests can lower temperatures by providing shade and boosting evapotranspiration. However, challenges like limited space, funding, and maintenance complicate these efforts. As climate change intensifies, tackling UHIs will be essential to making cities livable and sustainable in the future.",
