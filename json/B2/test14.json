  "passage": "<br>(1) The Reformation, a religious revolution that swept across Europe in the 16th century, fundamentally altered the landscape of Western Christianity and European society. This momentous period of religious upheaval began in 1517 when Martin Luther, a German monk and professor, published his Ninety-Five Theses criticizing practices of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the selling of indulgences. Luther's actions, facilitated by the recently invented printing press, sparked a movement that quickly spread beyond Germany, leading to the emergence of Protestant denominations and challenging the religious unity that had prevailed in Western Europe for centuries.<br><br>(2) While theological debates formed the core of the Reformation, its causes were multifaceted. Social discontent with clerical wealth and corruption had been growing, while the Renaissance had fostered intellectual currents that emphasized returning to original sources, including the Bible. Political rulers often supported reform movements to gain independence from papal authority and to seize church properties. Additionally, the emerging merchant class was attracted to Protestant teachings that seemed more compatible with commercial activities. Together, these factors created fertile ground for Luther's ideas to take root and flourish.<br><br>(3) The Reformation quickly diversified as reformers with different theological perspectives emerged. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli and later John Calvin developed reformed traditions that were more radical than Luther's approach. The English Reformation followed a unique path, driven initially by King Henry VIII's desire to annul his marriage rather than by theological concerns. Anabaptists advocated for adult baptism and complete separation of church and state, while the Counter-Reformation saw the Catholic Church implement internal reforms and vigorously oppose Protestant movements. This diversity of reform movements resulted in a fragmented religious landscape that replaced the previous Catholic hegemony.<br><br>(4) The consequences of the Reformation extended far beyond religion. Bloody conflicts erupted as religious differences became entangled with political ambitions, culminating in the devastating Thirty Years' War (1618-1648). Socially, the Protestant emphasis on individual Bible reading promoted literacy and education. The questioning of religious authority contributed to the development of critical thinking that would later characterize the Enlightenment. Additionally, the Reformation's stress on the "priesthood of all believers" had democratic implications that would influence political developments in subsequent centuries.<br><br>(5) The legacy of the Reformation continues to shape the modern world in profound ways. The religious pluralism of contemporary Western society can be traced directly to this period. The emphasis on individual conscience and interpretation created space for concepts of religious freedom that would eventually expand to broader notions of human rights. Educational institutions founded during this era remain influential centers of learning today. Perhaps most significantly, the Reformation established a precedent for challenging established authority that resonates in social and political movements to this day, making it one of history's most consequential episodes of ideological transformation.",
