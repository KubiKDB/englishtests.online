  "passage": "<br>(1) Sound is a type of energy that travels through the air, water, and other materials as a vibration. When an object vibrates, it causes the air molecules around it to move, creating waves that travel outward. These sound waves continue to travel until they reach our ears. The speed at which sound travels depends on the material it is moving through. For example, sound moves faster through water than through air.<br><br>(2) Our ears are designed to catch these sound waves and turn them into signals that our brain can understand. The outer part of the ear, called the pinna, collects sound waves and directs them into the ear canal. These waves then hit the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. The eardrum is connected to three tiny bones in the middle ear, which transfer these vibrations to the inner ear.<br><br>(3) Inside the inner ear is a snail-shaped structure called the cochlea, which is filled with fluid and lined with thousands of tiny hair cells. When the vibrations reach the cochlea, they cause the fluid to move, which bends the hair cells. These hair cells then convert the movement into electrical signals that travel along the auditory nerve to the brain, where they are interpreted as sound.<br><br>(4) Different sounds have different characteristics. The pitch of a sound, whether it is high or low, depends on the frequency of the sound waves. High-frequency waves produce high-pitched sounds, while low-frequency waves create low-pitched sounds. The volume or loudness of a sound is determined by the amplitude, or height, of the sound waves. Larger amplitude waves create louder sounds.<br><br>(5) Our ability to hear sounds can be affected by various factors. Exposure to very loud noises can damage the hair cells in the cochlea, leading to hearing loss. Age can also affect our hearing, as the hair cells naturally deteriorate over time. Additionally, the shape of our outer ear and ear canal can influence how well we hear certain frequencies of sound. Understanding how sound works and how we hear it can help us protect our hearing and appreciate the complex process that allows us to enjoy music, communicate with others, and interact with our environment.",
