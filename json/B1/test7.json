  "passage": "<br>(1) Banks are financial institutions that play a crucial role in our everyday lives. They serve as safe places where people and businesses can store their money. When you deposit money in a bank, it doesn't just sit in a vault waiting for you to withdraw it. Instead, the bank uses your money, along with other customers' deposits, to make loans to people who need to borrow funds for various purposes, such as buying homes, starting businesses, or paying for education.<br><br>(2) The way banks operate is through a system called fractional reserve banking. This means that banks keep only a fraction of the deposits as reserves and lend out the rest. When banks lend money, they charge interest, which is essentially a fee for borrowing the money. This interest is how banks make most of their profit. At the same time, banks also pay interest to depositors, although typically at a lower rate than what they charge borrowers. This difference between the interest rates is known as the 'spread,' and it's a key part of how banks generate income.<br><br>(3) Banks offer various services beyond just storing money and making loans. These include providing checking and savings accounts, issuing credit cards, facilitating electronic payments, and offering financial advice. Many banks also provide online and mobile banking services, allowing customers to manage their accounts and conduct transactions from anywhere at any time. These services have made banking more convenient and accessible to people around the world.<br><br>(4) Banks are important for the economy for several reasons. First, they facilitate the flow of money in the economy by connecting savers (depositors) with borrowers. This helps businesses grow, creates jobs, and stimulates economic activity. Second, banks provide a safe place for people to store their money, which promotes saving. Third, they offer payment systems that allow for efficient transactions, which is essential for commerce. Without banks, it would be much harder for people and businesses to buy and sell goods and services.<br><br>(5) However, banks also face risks, including the possibility that borrowers might not repay their loans (credit risk) and that many depositors might want to withdraw their money at the same time (liquidity risk). To address these risks, banks are regulated by government agencies that set rules about how much money banks must keep in reserve, how they can invest their funds, and how they must treat their customers. These regulations help ensure that banks remain stable and continue to serve their important functions in the economy.",
