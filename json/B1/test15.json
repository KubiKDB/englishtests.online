  "passage": "<br>(1) Enzymes play a crucial role in the digestive process within the human body. These specialized proteins act as catalysts, which means they speed up chemical reactions without being consumed in the process. In digestion, enzymes help break down large food molecules into smaller ones that can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream and used by the body.<br><br>(2) The digestive process begins in the mouth, where an enzyme called amylase is found in saliva. Amylase starts breaking down carbohydrates into simpler sugars as soon as food enters the mouth. This is why bread may begin to taste slightly sweet when chewed for a long time - the amylase is converting starches into sugars that can be detected by taste buds.<br><br>(3) As food moves through the digestive system, it encounters different enzymes in various organs. In the stomach, pepsin works to break down proteins into smaller peptides, while lipase from the pancreas helps digest fats in the small intestine. The pancreas also produces additional enzymes that continue the breakdown of carbohydrates and proteins.<br><br>(4) The small intestine is where most digestion occurs, with enzymes from the pancreas and the intestinal walls working together to break down food particles. Maltase, lactase, and sucrase in the small intestine complete the digestion of specific sugars, while peptidases finish breaking down protein fragments into individual amino acids.<br><br>(5) Without these enzymes, our bodies would be unable to extract nutrients efficiently from the food we eat. Some people lack certain digestive enzymes, which can lead to digestive problems. For example, those who lack sufficient lactase may have difficulty digesting lactose, the sugar found in milk and dairy products. Understanding the role of enzymes in digestion has helped scientists develop supplements and medications to assist those with digestive enzyme deficiencies.",
