    "passage": "<br>(1) The invention of the telephone in 1876 by Alexander Graham Bell revolutionized human communication in ways that previous generations could never have imagined. Before the telephone, people relied on written letters or face-to-face conversations to exchange information, which often meant long delays or significant travel. The telephone changed this by enabling immediate vocal communication across great distances, connecting people in real-time despite physical separation.<br><br>(2) Within decades of its invention, telephone networks expanded rapidly across countries and continents. By the early 20th century, telephone lines linked major cities, and gradually extended to suburban and rural areas. This expansion transformed business operations, allowing companies to coordinate activities across different locations and respond quickly to changing market conditions. For ordinary citizens, the telephone reduced isolation and provided a sense of security, especially in emergencies when immediate contact was crucial.<br><br>(3) The social impact of the telephone was equally profound. Family relationships changed as relatives could maintain close connections despite living far apart. The telephone also altered social etiquette, creating new customs and expectations around communication. People developed specific telephone manners, including standard greetings and conversational patterns. The immediacy of telephone calls also meant that individuals had less time to consider their responses compared to written correspondence, making communication more spontaneous but sometimes less thoughtful.<br><br>(4) Throughout the 20th century, telephone technology continued to evolve. Rotary phones gave way to touch-tone systems, while the introduction of mobile phones in the 1980s freed people from fixed locations. By the early 21st century, smartphones combined telephone functionality with internet access, messaging, and various applications, further transforming how people connect with one another. These developments have blurred the distinction between telephone calls and other forms of communication.<br><br>(5) Despite the rise of text messaging, social media, and video conferencing, voice calls remain an essential form of communication. The human voice conveys emotional nuances that written messages cannot capture, making telephone conversations particularly valuable for sensitive discussions. Additionally, telephone systems have become more reliable and accessible than ever before, with global coverage reaching even remote areas. The telephone's journey from a novel invention to an indispensable tool illustrates how a single technology can fundamentally reshape human interaction across society.",
