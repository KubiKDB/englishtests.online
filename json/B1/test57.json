  "passage": "<br>(1) DNA, which stands for deoxyribonucleic acid, is often referred to as the blueprint of life because it contains the instructions that all living organisms need to develop, function, and reproduce. Found in nearly every cell of every organism, DNA is a complex molecule that carries genetic information from one generation to the next. Its unique structure, resembling a twisted ladder or double helix, allows it to store vast amounts of information in a small space.<br><br>(2) The primary role of DNA is to store information in the form of genes. Genes are specific sequences of DNA that provide instructions for making proteins, which are essential for carrying out most cellular functions. Just as letters form words in a language, the four chemical bases of DNA—adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine—form a genetic code that cells can read. This code determines everything from eye color to how efficiently our bodies process certain nutrients.<br><br>(3) DNA also plays a crucial role in cell division and reproduction. Before a cell divides, it must replicate its DNA so that each new cell receives a complete set of genetic instructions. This process ensures that genetic information is passed accurately from parent cells to daughter cells. In sexual reproduction, DNA from both parents combines to create offspring with unique genetic characteristics, contributing to the diversity of life on Earth.<br><br>(4) Furthermore, DNA is involved in the body's response to environmental changes. Through a process called gene expression, cells can turn specific genes on or off in response to changes in their environment. This allows organisms to adapt to new conditions without changing their underlying genetic code. For example, exposure to sunlight can trigger cells to produce more melanin, the pigment that darkens skin, providing protection against harmful ultraviolet rays.<br><br>(5) Understanding DNA has revolutionized many fields, from medicine to agriculture. Scientists can now identify genetic disorders, develop targeted treatments, and even modify the DNA of plants to increase crop yields or resistance to disease. As research continues, our knowledge of how DNA functions in living organisms expands, opening new possibilities for improving health and addressing global challenges like food security and disease prevention.",
