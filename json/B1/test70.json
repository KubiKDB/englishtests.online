  "passage": "<br>(1) The world's oceans, covering more than 70 percent of Earth's surface, have long been affected by human activities. Over the past century, these impacts have intensified dramatically as population growth and technological advancements have increased our ability to exploit marine resources. From fishing and shipping to waste disposal and coastal development, human activities are placing unprecedented pressure on ocean ecosystems worldwide.<br><br>(2) One of the most significant threats to marine environments is pollution. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste enter the oceans, harming marine animals who mistake it for food or become entangled in it. Chemical pollutants, including fertilizers from agricultural runoff, industrial waste, and oil spills, further contaminate ocean waters. These pollutants not only kill marine life directly but can also accumulate in the food chain, eventually affecting human health when we consume seafood.<br><br>(3) Overfishing represents another major human impact on oceans. Advanced fishing technologies and growing demand for seafood have led to the depletion of many fish populations worldwide. According to recent studies, more than one-third of fish stocks are being harvested at unsustainable levels. This overexploitation disrupts marine food webs and threatens the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on fishing for their income and food security.<br><br>(4) Climate change, largely driven by human emissions of greenhouse gases, is perhaps the most pervasive threat to ocean health. Rising ocean temperatures are causing coral bleaching events, while increased carbon dioxide levels are leading to ocean acidification. These changes make it difficult for shell-forming organisms like corals, mollusks, and some plankton species to build their calcium carbonate structures, potentially disrupting entire marine ecosystems.<br><br>(5) Despite these challenges, there are reasons for hope. Conservation efforts, including the establishment of marine protected areas, are helping to preserve biodiversity and allow depleted fish stocks to recover. Innovations in sustainable fishing practices, renewable energy, and plastic alternatives are reducing human impacts on the oceans. Public awareness about ocean conservation is growing, prompting individuals, businesses, and governments to take action to protect these vital ecosystems for future generations.",
