  "passage": "<br>(1) The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, revolutionized transportation in the early 20th century with their invention of the first successful airplane. Before their achievement, humans had dreamed of flying for thousands of years, but all previous attempts had failed. The brothers, who ran a bicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio, combined mechanical skills with careful scientific observation to solve the complex problems of flight. Their determination and methodical approach ultimately changed how people and goods would move around the world.<br><br>(2) The brothers began their aviation experiments in 1899, studying birds and existing research on flight. Unlike many inventors of their time, they focused on three essential elements: lift, control, and power. They built and tested numerous gliders to understand how wings generate lift, developed a control system that allowed the pilot to balance and steer the aircraft, and designed a lightweight engine powerful enough for flight. After years of testing, they were ready to attempt powered flight.<br><br>(3) On December 17, 1903, near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, the Wright brothers made history. Orville piloted the first powered flight, which lasted just 12 seconds and covered 120 feet. Though brief, this achievement proved that powered flight was possible. They made three more flights that day, with Wilbur's final flight covering 852 feet in 59 seconds. The age of aviation had begun, though many people initially doubted the reports of their success.<br><br>(4) In the years following their first flight, the Wright brothers continued to improve their designs. By 1905, they had developed the Wright Flyer III, which could stay airborne for up to 39 minutes and fly in circles and figure-eights. They secured patents for their inventions and began demonstrating their aircraft in Europe and America, finally gaining recognition for their achievement. Governments and businesses quickly recognized the potential of airplanes for military use, mail delivery, and eventually passenger transportation.<br><br>(5) The impact of the Wright brothers' invention on transportation cannot be overstated. Within decades, airplanes transformed from experimental machines into essential tools for global commerce and travel. Air travel shortened journeys that once took weeks or months to just hours, connecting distant parts of the world like never before. Today's massive aviation industry, with its worldwide network of flights carrying billions of passengers annually, began with those 12 seconds at Kitty Hawk. The Wright brothers' innovation fundamentally altered human mobility and helped create our interconnected modern world.",
