  "passage": "<br>(1) The Olympic Games were one of the most important cultural events in ancient Greece, bringing together athletes from various city-states to compete in honor of Zeus. The games began around 776 BCE in Olympia and continued for nearly twelve centuries until they were banned by the Roman Emperor Theodosius I in 393 CE. Unlike modern Olympics, the ancient games were as much a religious festival as they were a sporting event, deeply connected to Greek religious beliefs and practices.<br><br>(2) During the Olympic Games, a sacred truce called the 'ekecheiria' was declared across all Greek territories. This truce allowed athletes, spectators, and their families to travel safely to Olympia without fear of attack or harassment. The games thus served as a unifying force among the often-warring Greek city-states, promoting a sense of shared Hellenic identity and values despite political differences. Even during times of conflict, the Olympic truce was generally respected.<br><br>(3) The original Olympic Games featured far fewer events than today's modern version. Initially, the only competition was a footrace called the 'stade,' which was approximately 200 meters long. Over time, additional events were added, including longer races, wrestling, boxing, chariot racing, and the pentathlon. Unlike modern Olympics, only free men who spoke Greek could participate, while women, slaves, and foreigners were prohibited from competing. Winners received olive wreaths cut from the sacred trees of Olympia rather than gold medals.<br><br>(4) Beyond athletic competition, the Olympic Games were crucial for cultural exchange and intellectual development. Poets, philosophers, and orators gathered at the games to share their works with wide audiences. Merchants established temporary markets, making the games an important commercial center. Political leaders used the occasion for diplomatic meetings and to announce important treaties or declarations. In this way, the Olympics functioned as a multifaceted cultural institution.<br><br>(5) The legacy of the ancient Olympic Games extends far beyond athletics. They established principles that influenced Greek culture and, later, Western civilization: the concept of peaceful competition, the celebration of human physical achievement, and the ideal of temporary unity despite political differences. When the modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896, organizers deliberately connected them to this ancient tradition, recognizing the powerful cultural significance the games had held centuries earlier.",
