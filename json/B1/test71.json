  "passage": "<br>(1) Hurricanes are powerful tropical storms that form over warm ocean waters and can cause devastating damage when they reach land. These massive weather systems, also known as cyclones or typhoons in different parts of the world, are characterized by strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges that can flood coastal areas. When a hurricane makes landfall, it can destroy buildings, uproot trees, and cause extensive flooding that affects communities for weeks or even months after the storm has passed.<br><br>(2) The formation of a hurricane begins with warm ocean water, typically at least 80°F (27°C), which provides the energy needed to fuel these powerful storms. As warm, moist air rises from the ocean surface, it creates an area of low pressure below. More air rushes in to fill this space, becomes warm and moist, and also rises. This continuous process forms clouds and thunderstorms while creating a circular pattern of winds around the low-pressure center. If conditions remain favorable, this system can strengthen into a tropical depression, then a tropical storm, and finally a hurricane.<br><br>(3) Hurricanes are classified using the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which ranges from Category 1 (winds of 74-95 mph) to Category 5 (winds over 157 mph). The higher the category, the more destructive potential the hurricane has. At the center of a hurricane is the eye, a relatively calm area typically 20-40 miles wide. Surrounding the eye is the eyewall, where the most severe weather and strongest winds occur. Rain bands extending outward from the eyewall can bring heavy precipitation to areas hundreds of miles from the hurricane's center.<br><br>(4) Climate change is affecting hurricanes in several important ways. Warmer ocean temperatures provide more energy for hurricanes to form and intensify, potentially leading to stronger storms. Rising sea levels increase the risk and impact of storm surges, pushing more water inland during hurricanes. There is also evidence suggesting that hurricanes may be moving more slowly, allowing them to drop more rain in one area and increasing flood risks. Scientists continue to study these trends to better understand how hurricane patterns may change in the future.<br><br>(5) Preparing for hurricanes is essential for people living in vulnerable coastal areas. Early warning systems using satellites and aircraft reconnaissance help meteorologists track hurricanes and predict their paths. This information allows authorities to issue evacuation orders when necessary. Individuals can prepare by creating emergency plans, assembling supply kits, and securing their homes. Communities can develop infrastructure like seawalls and storm drainage systems to reduce damage. Despite these efforts, hurricanes remain one of nature's most powerful and destructive forces, reminding us of the importance of both preparation and respect for the natural world.",
