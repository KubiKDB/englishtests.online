  "passage": "<br>(1) Money, as we know it today, did not always exist. Before the invention of currency, early human societies relied on a system called bartering, where people directly exchanged goods and services. For instance, a farmer might trade excess crops for tools made by a craftsman. While this system worked for simple exchanges, it presented significant challenges when the desired items were not easily divisible or when people couldn't agree on relative values.<br><br>(2) The earliest forms of standardized money appeared around 5000 BCE when ancient civilizations began using commodity money â€“ items that had intrinsic value and could be used for trade. Cattle, salt, shells, and beads were among the first forms of commodity money. Cowrie shells, in particular, were used across Africa, Asia, and parts of Oceania due to their durability, portability, and relative scarcity. These natural items served as an early medium of exchange and store of value.<br><br>(3) Precious metals eventually became the preferred form of money due to their scarcity, durability, and divisibility. By around 1000 BCE, early coins made of gold, silver, and bronze emerged in China and parts of the Mediterranean region. The kingdom of Lydia (in modern-day Turkey) is often credited with producing the first official coinage around 600 BCE. These early coins were essentially standardized pieces of precious metal stamped with symbols to guarantee their weight and purity.<br><br>(4) Paper money developed much later, first appearing in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE). The Chinese found that carrying large amounts of coins was impractical for merchants, so they developed a system of credit notes. These early banknotes represented a promise to pay the bearer a specific amount of precious metal. The concept gradually spread to Europe through traders, though Europeans were initially skeptical of paper currency not backed by immediate physical value.<br><br>(5) Modern banking systems evolved alongside these developments in currency. By the 17th century, goldsmiths in England began storing people's gold for safekeeping and issuing receipts that could be exchanged for goods. Eventually, these receipts circulated as a form of paper money, and goldsmiths realized they could lend out more receipts than the gold they actually held, giving birth to the fractional reserve banking system that forms the foundation of today's global economy.",
