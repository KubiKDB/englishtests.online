  "passage": "<br>(1) The Earth's rotation is the movement of our planet around its axis, which is an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles. This rotation is what causes the cycle of day and night that we experience. As the Earth completes one full rotation every 24 hours, different parts of the planet face toward or away from the Sun at different times.<br><br>(2) When a particular location on Earth faces the Sun, that area experiences daytime. The sunlight directly hits this part of the planet, providing warmth and light. Meanwhile, the opposite side of the Earth faces away from the Sun and experiences nighttime. This creates the basic pattern of light and darkness that regulates many natural processes on our planet.<br><br>(3) The Earth's rotation also affects how we experience the passage of time. Time zones were created as a practical solution to the fact that different parts of the Earth experience daylight at different times. There are 24 main time zones around the world, roughly corresponding to each hour in a day. This system allows people to maintain consistent schedules despite the Earth's continuous rotation.<br><br>(4) Interestingly, the Earth's rotation is not perfectly consistent. It actually slows down very gradually over time, mainly due to the gravitational effects of the Moon. Scientists estimate that the Earth's day lengthens by about 1.7 milliseconds every century. While this change is too small to notice in our daily lives, over millions of years, it has significant effects.<br><br>(5) The rotation of the Earth also influences many natural phenomena beyond just day and night. It affects ocean tides, weather patterns, and even the direction of winds and ocean currents. The Coriolis effect, caused by the Earth's rotation, makes moving objects appear to curve to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This effect plays a crucial role in global weather systems and ocean circulation patterns.",
