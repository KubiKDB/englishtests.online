  "passage": "<br>(1) The invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century by Johannes Gutenberg revolutionized how people shared information across Europe and eventually around the world. Before this remarkable invention, books were painstakingly copied by hand, making them rare and expensive. Gutenberg's printing press used movable metal type, which allowed for much faster and more affordable book production.<br><br>(2) The immediate impact of the printing press was dramatic. Within just 50 years of its invention, more than twenty million volumes had been printed. Books became accessible to people beyond just the wealthy elite and religious institutions. This widespread availability of books helped spread new ideas and information at an unprecedented speed throughout society.<br><br>(3) One of the most significant effects of the printing press was on education and literacy. As books became more common, more people were motivated to learn how to read. Schools began to appear in greater numbers, and education gradually became available to ordinary citizens, not just the privileged few. The standardization of texts also meant that people in different locations could study the same material.<br><br>(4) The printing press also played a crucial role in major historical events. It helped spread the ideas of the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. Martin Luther's translation of the Bible into German, which was widely distributed thanks to the printing press, allowed ordinary people to read religious texts in their own language for the first time. Political movements and scientific discoveries could now reach a much broader audience.<br><br>(5) Today, we can see parallels between Gutenberg's invention and the internet. Both technologies dramatically changed how information is shared and who can access it. Just as the printing press democratized knowledge in the 15th century, the internet has made information instantly available to billions of people worldwide. The printing press remains one of the most important inventions in human history, laying the groundwork for the information age in which we now live.",
