  "passage": "<br>(1) Magnetism is one of the fundamental forces in our universe that has fascinated humans for thousands of years. The ancient Greeks discovered that certain stones, now known as magnetite, could attract iron objects. These naturally occurring magnets were called lodestones. Today, we understand that magnetism results from the motion of electric charges, particularly electrons, which create magnetic fields.<br><br>(2) At the atomic level, magnetism occurs because electrons spin and orbit around the nucleus of an atom, generating tiny magnetic fields. In most materials, these fields point in random directions and cancel each other out. However, in ferromagnetic materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt, the atomic magnetic fields align in the same direction, creating a strong magnetic effect. This alignment can happen naturally or when these materials are exposed to an existing magnetic field.<br><br>(3) Every magnet has two poles: north and south. Similar poles (north-north or south-south) repel each other, while opposite poles (north-south) attract. This fundamental property is known as the law of magnetic attraction and repulsion. The magnetic field surrounding a magnet is invisible but can be visualized using iron filings or a compass. The field lines always flow from the north pole to the south pole outside the magnet, forming closed loops.<br><br>(4) Magnets have countless applications in modern technology. They are essential components in electric motors, generators, and transformers, which convert electrical energy to mechanical energy and vice versa. Computer hard drives use magnetic materials to store data. Medical devices like MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machines use powerful magnets to create detailed images of the human body. Even everyday items like refrigerator magnets, credit cards, and speakers rely on magnetic principles.<br><br>(5) Earth itself acts as a giant magnet with magnetic poles located near the geographic North and South Poles. This planetary magnetism creates the Earth's magnetic field, which extends thousands of kilometers into space, forming the magnetosphere. This magnetic shield protects us from harmful solar radiation and cosmic rays. Interestingly, the Earth's magnetic poles have reversed multiple times throughout geological history, with the north becoming south and vice versa, a process that takes thousands of years to complete.",
