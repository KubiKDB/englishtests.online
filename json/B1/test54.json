  "passage": "<br>(1) Mountains are some of the most impressive natural features on Earth, with the world's largest peaks reaching heights that seem to touch the sky. These massive geological formations are found on every continent and have been formed over millions of years through powerful natural processes. The tallest mountains in the world are primarily located in the Himalayan range in Asia, with Mount Everest standing as the highest peak at 8,848 meters above sea level.<br><br>(2) Most of the world's largest mountains were formed through a process called plate tectonics. The Earth's crust is divided into several large plates that float on the semi-liquid mantle beneath. When these plates collide with each other, the enormous pressure forces the land to fold and rise, creating mountain ranges. This collision process is responsible for the formation of the Himalayas, which began forming about 50 million years ago when the Indian subcontinent collided with Asia.<br><br>(3) Another way mountains form is through volcanic activity. Volcanic mountains are created when magma from deep within the Earth pushes through the crust and builds up on the surface. Over time, as more magma and ash accumulate, a mountain is formed. Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania are examples of mountains formed primarily through volcanic processes. These mountains often have distinctive cone shapes and may still be active volcanoes.<br><br>(4) The Alps in Europe formed in a similar way to the Himalayas, through the collision of the African and European plates. However, the Rocky Mountains in North America were created through a different process called subduction, where one tectonic plate slides underneath another. This caused the western edge of the North American continent to be pushed upward, creating the extensive mountain range we see today.<br><br>(5) Mountains continue to evolve even after their initial formation. Forces such as erosion from wind, water, and ice gradually wear down these massive structures. Glaciers carve distinctive valleys and peaks, while rivers cut through mountain ranges, creating deep gorges. Despite these erosive forces, many of the world's largest mountains are still growing slightly each year due to ongoing tectonic activity, demonstrating that our planet's surface is in a constant state of change.",
