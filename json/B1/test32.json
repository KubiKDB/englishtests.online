  "passage": "<br>(1) Earthquakes are natural phenomena that occur when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, creating seismic waves. While these events can happen virtually anywhere on our planet, certain regions experience them with much greater frequency and intensity than others. This uneven distribution of seismic activity is primarily related to the structure of the Earth and the movement of tectonic plates.<br><br>(2) The Earth's outer layer is broken into large pieces called tectonic plates, which float on the semi-fluid layer beneath them. These plates are constantly moving, albeit very slowly – typically just a few centimeters per year. When plates interact at their boundaries, they can either move away from each other, slide past one another, or collide. It is at these boundaries where the majority of earthquakes occur, as the movement creates stress that builds up until it is released in the form of seismic activity.<br><br>(3) The Ring of Fire, a horseshoe-shaped belt that runs along the edges of the Pacific Ocean, is particularly prone to earthquakes. This area contains about 75% of the world's active volcanoes and experiences approximately 90% of all earthquakes. Countries like Japan, Chile, and the western United States are located along this ring and consequently face a much higher risk of seismic events than regions situated in the middle of tectonic plates, such as much of Africa and central Russia.<br><br>(4) Not all plate boundaries, however, produce the same level of seismic activity. Convergent boundaries, where plates move toward each other, often create the most powerful earthquakes. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake in Japan, both of which triggered devastating tsunamis, occurred at convergent boundaries. Transform boundaries, where plates slide horizontally past each other, can also generate significant earthquakes, as evidenced by those along California's San Andreas Fault.<br><br>(5) While technology has advanced our understanding of earthquake patterns, precisely predicting when and where they will occur remains challenging. Scientists continue to study seismic activity to develop better prediction methods and building codes that can help minimize damage in earthquake-prone regions. For people living in these areas, awareness of evacuation procedures and earthquake-resistant infrastructure is crucial for reducing the potential impact of these powerful natural events.",
