  "passage": "<br>(1) Rivers and lakes are both essential bodies of water that sustain life on our planet, yet they differ significantly in their characteristics and functions. Rivers are flowing water bodies that move continuously in one direction, usually originating from mountains or hills and eventually emptying into seas, oceans, or larger rivers. In contrast, lakes are relatively still water bodies contained in depressions in the land, surrounded by land on all sides except where a river or stream enters or exits.<br><br>(2) The movement of water creates one of the most noticeable differences between these two water bodies. Rivers are characterized by their constant flow, which can range from gentle streams to powerful currents. This continuous movement affects everything from water temperature to the types of organisms that can survive in river environments. Lakes, however, are generally stationary bodies of water with minimal flow except near inlets and outlets. The still nature of lakes allows for temperature stratification, where different layers of water have distinct temperatures.<br><br>(3) The physical formation of rivers and lakes also differs considerably. Rivers typically form when precipitation or melting snow accumulates in sufficient quantity to create a flow of water that carves channels into the land. Over time, these channels deepen and widen through erosion. Lakes, on the other hand, can form through various geological processes including glacier movement, volcanic activity, tectonic plate shifts, or even human intervention through dam construction.<br><br>(4) The ecosystems supported by rivers and lakes vary due to their different physical conditions. River ecosystems must adapt to flowing water and changing conditions. Species living in rivers often have special adaptations to prevent being swept away by currents. Lake ecosystems tend to be more stable and can support a wider variety of plant life, particularly around their shores. Lakes often develop distinct zones of plant and animal life extending from the shoreline to the deepest areas.<br><br>(5) Finally, rivers and lakes serve different roles in human civilization and development. Throughout history, rivers have been crucial for transportation, agriculture, and as boundaries between territories. They continue to be important for navigation, hydroelectric power generation, and as sources of irrigation water. Lakes, while also providing water for human use, are often valued for their recreational opportunities, aesthetic beauty, and as habitats for fish that provide food sources. Both water bodies face threats from pollution and climate change, making their conservation increasingly important.",
