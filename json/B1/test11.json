  "passage": "<br>(1) Glaciers are massive bodies of ice that form over many years when snow accumulates and compresses. This process begins when snowfall remains on the ground year-round, gradually building up layer upon layer. Over time, the weight of the upper layers compresses the snow beneath, forcing out air pockets and transforming it into dense ice. This transformation can take decades or even centuries, depending on climate conditions and the amount of snowfall in a particular region.<br><br>(2) The formation of a glacier requires specific conditions. Most importantly, the climate must be cold enough for snow to remain frozen throughout the year, even during summer months. Additionally, there must be enough snowfall to maintain and build the glacier's mass. When the accumulation of snow exceeds the amount that melts away, a glacier can form and continue to grow. These conditions are commonly found in polar regions and high mountain areas around the world.<br><br>(3) Glaciers are not static formations but are constantly moving due to their immense weight and the force of gravity. As a glacier grows heavier, the pressure causes the ice to become more plastic and flexible. This allows the ice to flow slowly downhill, similar to a very thick liquid. This movement, though extremely slow, can reshape landscapes over time as the massive ice sheets carve valleys and move enormous amounts of rock and soil.<br><br>(4) The speed at which glaciers move varies significantly. Some glaciers may advance only a few centimeters per day, while others can move several meters. Factors affecting glacier movement include the slope of the land, the thickness of the ice, the temperature, and the presence of water at the base of the glacier. Water acts as a lubricant, allowing the ice to slide more easily over the ground beneath it. In warmer periods, increased meltwater can temporarily accelerate a glacier's movement.<br><br>(5) As glaciers move, they dramatically reshape the landscape through various processes. The base and sides of a glacier pick up rocks and sediment, which act like sandpaper against the land. This process, called glacial erosion, carves out distinctive U-shaped valleys and creates features such as cirques, arÃªtes, and horns. When glaciers retreat, they deposit the carried materials, forming moraines and other glacial deposits. These processes have shaped many of Earth's most spectacular mountain landscapes throughout geological history.",
