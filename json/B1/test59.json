  "passage": "<br>(1) Trade played a crucial role in the development and expansion of ancient empires throughout history. As civilizations grew, they established networks of exchange that connected distant regions and diverse cultures. These trade routes facilitated not only the movement of goods but also the spread of ideas, technologies, and religious beliefs across vast distances.<br><br>(2) The Roman Empire, for example, created an extensive trade network that stretched from Britain to North Africa and from Spain to the Middle East. Roman roads and sea routes allowed merchants to transport olive oil, wine, textiles, and precious metals throughout the empire. This commercial activity generated wealth that supported the empire's military campaigns and impressive architectural projects. The stability provided by Roman rule, known as Pax Romana, created favorable conditions for trade to flourish.<br><br>(3) Similarly, the Han Dynasty in China established the famous Silk Road, linking East Asia with Central Asia, the Middle East, and eventually Europe. Chinese silk was highly valued in distant markets, and in exchange, China imported horses, jade, and other luxury items. The Silk Road became not just an economic lifeline but also a cultural bridge between East and West. Many cities along this route, such as Samarkand and Bukhara, grew into important centers of learning and commerce.<br><br>(4) In the Americas, the Aztec Empire controlled marketplaces where goods from throughout Mesoamerica were bought and sold. The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, featured a grand market at Tlatelolco where thousands of merchants gathered daily. The empire collected taxes from these commercial activities, which helped fund its military and religious institutions. Trade was so important to Aztec society that professional merchants formed their own social class with special privileges.<br><br>(5) Trade not only contributed to economic prosperity but also shaped the political landscape of ancient empires. Control over valuable resources and trade routes often determined which civilizations rose to power and which declined. Empires that successfully managed and protected their trade networks tended to thrive, while those that lost control of key routes often faced economic hardship and eventual collapse. Thus, trade served as both a foundation for imperial growth and a measure of imperial strength.",
