  "passage": "<br>(1) Supply and demand is a fundamental economic concept that explains how prices are determined in a market. Supply refers to the amount of goods that producers are willing to sell at various prices, while demand represents the amount of goods that consumers are willing to buy at different prices. These two forces work together to establish the market price and quantity of goods sold.<br><br>(2) The law of demand states that as the price of a product increases, the quantity demanded decreases, assuming all other factors remain constant. This happens because consumers typically seek alternatives or reduce consumption when prices rise. Conversely, when prices fall, consumers are generally willing to purchase more of a product, leading to an increase in quantity demanded.<br><br>(3) The law of supply works in the opposite direction. As prices increase, producers are motivated to supply more goods to the market because higher prices usually mean higher profits. When prices decrease, producers may find it less profitable to sell their goods and might reduce production, resulting in a lower quantity supplied to the market.<br><br>(4) When supply and demand interact, they tend to move toward a state of equilibrium. Equilibrium occurs at the price point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied. At this point, there is no pressure for prices to change further, as both consumers and producers are satisfied with the current market conditions.<br><br>(5) Various factors can shift the supply and demand curves, causing changes in equilibrium prices and quantities. For instance, advancements in technology might reduce production costs, shifting the supply curve rightward and potentially lowering prices. Similarly, changes in consumer preferences, income levels, or the prices of related goods can shift the demand curve, affecting the market equilibrium.",
