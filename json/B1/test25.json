    "passage": "<br>(1) The Eiffel Tower, one of the world's most recognizable landmarks, was built for the 1889 World's Fair in Paris. The tower was designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company specialized in constructing metal frameworks and structures. Initially, many Parisians opposed the tower, considering it an eyesore that would dominate the city's elegant skyline.<br><br>(2) Construction of the Eiffel Tower began in January 1887 and was completed in just over two years. The tower consists of 18,038 pieces of wrought iron held together by 2.5 million rivets. The innovative design used an open lattice structure, which reduced wind resistance while maintaining strength. This engineering approach allowed the tower to reach a height of 984 feet (300 meters), making it the tallest man-made structure in the world at that time.<br><br>(3) Building the Eiffel Tower required meticulous planning and precise execution. Workers assembled each section on the ground before lifting it into place using steam-powered cranes. Remarkably, only one worker died during construction, which was an impressive safety record for the era. The total cost of the project was approximately 7.8 million francs, but ticket sales during the 1889 World's Fair covered much of this expense.<br><br>(4) Although initially intended as a temporary structure to be dismantled after 20 years, the Eiffel Tower was saved because of its value for communication purposes. During World War I, the tower intercepted enemy radio transmissions and relayed messages to troops. Today, the tower serves as a broadcasting antenna for radio and television signals throughout Paris.<br><br>(5) The Eiffel Tower has become not only a symbol of Paris but also a global icon of French culture and ingenuity. It attracts nearly seven million visitors annually, making it one of the world's most visited paid monuments. The tower has inspired replicas in various cities and has been featured in countless films, photographs, and works of art. Its enduring popularity demonstrates how a once-controversial structure has transformed into a beloved masterpiece of architectural and engineering achievement.",
