  "passage": "<br>(1) The Earth orbits around the sun once every 365.25 days, but the Earth's axis of rotation is not perpendicular to its orbital plane. Instead, it is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees from the vertical. This tilt remains pointed in the same direction throughout the year, which means that as the Earth travels around the sun, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times.<br><br>(2) When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it receives more direct sunlight and experiences summer. During this same period, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, receiving less direct sunlight and experiencing winter. Six months later, the situation reverses, with the Southern Hemisphere enjoying summer while the Northern Hemisphere endures winter.<br><br>(3) The changing seasons affect not only temperature but also the length of daylight. During summer in either hemisphere, that region experiences more hours of daylight than darkness. This happens because a larger portion of that hemisphere remains in sunlight during the Earth's daily rotation. Conversely, winter days are shorter because less of that hemisphere is exposed to sunlight as the Earth rotates.<br><br>(4) Spring and autumn (fall) occur during the transitional periods when neither hemisphere is significantly tilted toward or away from the sun. During these seasons, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of sunlight, resulting in moderate temperatures between the extremes of summer and winter. These are known as the equinoxes, when day and night are approximately equal in length across the globe.<br><br>(5) It is important to understand that the Earth's distance from the sun is not the primary factor causing the seasons. In fact, the Earth is actually closest to the sun in January, during winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This demonstrates that it is the angle at which sunlight strikes the Earth, determined by the planet's axial tilt, rather than proximity to the sun, that is responsible for the changing seasons we experience throughout the year.",
