  "passage": "<br>(1) The equator, an imaginary line that circles the Earth at 0 degrees latitude, plays a crucial role in determining our planet's climate patterns. This invisible belt divides Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres and receives the most direct sunlight throughout the year. Unlike regions farther from the equator, equatorial areas experience minimal seasonal temperature variation, with consistently warm conditions year-round.<br><br>(2) One of the most significant impacts of the equator on global climate is its influence on atmospheric circulation. The intense solar radiation at the equator heats the air, causing it to rise and creating a low-pressure zone known as the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). As this warm air rises, it cools and releases moisture, resulting in the heavy rainfall characteristic of tropical regions. The air then flows north and south at high altitudes before descending at approximately 30 degrees latitude in both hemispheres, forming subtropical high-pressure areas.<br><br>(3) The equatorial regions' consistent warmth also affects ocean currents, which further influence global climate patterns. Warm water from the equator moves toward the poles, while cooler water from higher latitudes flows toward the equator. This circulation helps distribute heat around the planet, moderating temperatures in coastal regions. The most well-known example of this phenomenon is the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which can significantly impact weather patterns worldwide when equatorial Pacific Ocean temperatures change.<br><br>(4) The equator's influence extends to biodiversity as well. The stable climate conditions and abundant rainfall of equatorial regions support some of the world's most diverse ecosystems, including tropical rainforests and coral reefs. These environments act as carbon sinks, absorbing significant amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, they are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as even small temperature increases can disrupt delicate ecological balances that have evolved under stable conditions.<br><br>(5) Understanding the equator's role in climate regulation has become increasingly important as global temperatures rise. Climate models suggest that global warming may alter traditional rainfall patterns near the equator, potentially causing the ITCZ to shift and affecting agriculture and water availability for millions of people. Additionally, as polar ice melts, the temperature difference between the equator and poles decreases, which could weaken the atmospheric circulation patterns that have traditionally distributed heat and moisture around our planet.",
