  "passage": "<br>(1) International trade is the exchange of goods and services between countries around the world. It has become an essential part of the global economy, connecting nations through the buying and selling of products. Countries engage in international trade because they can obtain goods that they cannot produce themselves or can get them at a lower cost from other nations.<br><br>(2) One of the main benefits of international trade is economic growth. When countries specialize in producing goods they can make efficiently and trade for what they cannot, overall production increases. This specialization leads to higher productivity and lower prices for consumers worldwide. Additionally, international trade creates jobs in export industries and provides a wider variety of products for consumers to choose from.<br><br>(3) Technology has dramatically changed how international trade operates. The internet and improved transportation systems have made it easier for businesses of all sizes to participate in global markets. Small companies can now reach customers across the world through online platforms, while large corporations can manage complex supply chains spanning multiple countries. These advancements have accelerated the pace and volume of international trade in recent decades.<br><br>(4) Despite its benefits, international trade also presents challenges. Trade disputes between nations can lead to tariffs and other barriers that disrupt the flow of goods. Environmental concerns about shipping emissions and labor standards in developing countries have also raised questions about certain trade practices. Finding a balance between open markets and appropriate regulations remains an ongoing issue for policymakers.<br><br>(5) Looking to the future, international trade will continue to evolve as the global economy changes. Emerging markets in Asia and Africa are becoming more important trading partners. Digital services and intellectual property are forming a growing portion of traded goods. As these trends develop, international cooperation will be essential to ensure that trade benefits people across all nations and economic backgrounds.",
