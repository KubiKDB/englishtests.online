  "passage": "<br>(1) Human digestion is a complex process that begins even before food enters the mouth. When we see, smell, or think about food, our bodies start to produce saliva, which contains enzymes that begin breaking down food. Once food enters the mouth, it is chewed into smaller pieces and mixed with saliva, making it easier to swallow. This partially digested food, now called a bolus, travels down the esophagus to the stomach through a process called peristalsis, which involves muscle contractions that push food along the digestive tract.<br><br>(2) The stomach is a muscular organ that further breaks down food both physically and chemically. It contains strong acids and enzymes that help digest proteins and kill harmful bacteria. The stomach churns and mixes food with these digestive juices, turning it into a semi-liquid mixture called chyme. This process can take anywhere from 40 minutes to several hours, depending on the type and amount of food consumed. Once the food has been properly broken down in the stomach, it moves into the small intestine.<br><br>(3) The small intestine is where most nutrient absorption takes place. It is approximately 20 feet long and is lined with millions of tiny finger-like projections called villi, which increase the surface area for absorption. Here, digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile from the liver continue to break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats into their simplest forms. These nutrients are then absorbed through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream, which carries them to cells throughout the body. The process of nutrient absorption is vital for providing energy and materials needed for cell growth, repair, and overall body function.<br><br>(4) After passing through the small intestine, the remaining material, which consists mostly of water and indigestible food components like fiber, enters the large intestine or colon. The colon is about 5 feet long and its main function is to absorb water and electrolytes from the remaining material. Bacteria in the colon help break down some remaining nutrients and produce certain vitamins, like vitamin K. As water is absorbed, the waste material becomes more solid, forming stool. This waste material is stored in the rectum until it is eliminated from the body through the anus during bowel movements.<br><br>(5) The entire digestive process is regulated by both the nervous system and hormones. Various hormones signal different digestive organs to release enzymes or increase muscle contractions at the appropriate times. The nervous system also plays a crucial role, as it responds to the presence of food and coordinates the various phases of digestion. Problems with digestion can occur at any stage of this complex process and may lead to conditions such as acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, or nutrient deficiencies. Maintaining a healthy digestive system through proper diet, regular exercise, and stress management is essential for overall health and wellbeing.",
