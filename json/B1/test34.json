  "passage": "<br>(1) Oceans play a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate system. Covering more than 70 percent of our planet's surface, oceans absorb and store enormous amounts of heat from the sun. This heat absorption helps maintain global temperatures at levels suitable for life. Without oceans, Earth would experience much more extreme temperature variations, making many regions uninhabitable for numerous plant and animal species.<br><br>(2) One of the most important functions of oceans is carbon dioxide absorption. Oceans act as carbon sinks, taking in about one-quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans release into the atmosphere through activities like burning fossil fuels. This process helps slow the pace of climate change by reducing the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. However, as carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater, it forms carbonic acid, leading to ocean acidification, which threatens marine life, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons.<br><br>(3) Ocean currents serve as global conveyor belts, transporting heat from the equator toward the poles. The Gulf Stream, for example, carries warm water from the Gulf of Mexico across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe, making the European climate much milder than it would otherwise be at that latitude. These currents are driven by differences in water temperature and salinity, a complex system known as thermohaline circulation. Scientists worry that climate change could disrupt these crucial current patterns, potentially causing dramatic shifts in regional climates.<br><br>(4) The relationship between oceans and weather patterns is particularly evident in phenomena like El Niño and La Niña. These periodic changes in ocean temperature in the Pacific can influence weather around the globe, causing droughts in some regions and flooding in others. Such events demonstrate how oceanic conditions can have far-reaching effects on climate worldwide, affecting agriculture, water resources, and natural ecosystems thousands of miles away from the source.<br><br>(5) As global temperatures rise due to climate change, oceans face numerous challenges. Sea levels are increasing as ice sheets and glaciers melt and as seawater expands when warmed. Ocean circulation patterns may shift, affecting marine ecosystems and coastal communities. Despite these challenges, oceans continue to buffer the effects of climate change, highlighting their importance to Earth's climate system. Protecting ocean health is therefore not only vital for marine life but also essential for maintaining the stability of our global climate.",
