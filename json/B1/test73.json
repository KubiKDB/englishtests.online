  "passage": "<br>(1) Clouds are one of the most visible and important features of our atmosphere. They form when water vapor in the air condenses into tiny water droplets or ice crystals. This process begins when warm air containing water vapor rises into the cooler regions of the atmosphere. As the air temperature decreases with altitude, the water vapor cools and its density increases, leading to condensation. However, water vapor needs a surface to condense on, and in the atmosphere, these surfaces are typically microscopic particles called condensation nuclei.<br><br>(2) The formation of clouds depends on several factors. First, there must be sufficient moisture in the air. Second, there must be a cooling mechanism to lower the temperature of the air. Finally, there must be condensation nuclei present for water droplets to form. Different types of clouds develop based on the altitude at which they form and the atmospheric conditions present. For example, cumulus clouds, with their flat bottoms and fluffy tops, form at lower altitudes, while high, wispy cirrus clouds develop in the upper troposphere where temperatures are much colder.<br><br>(3) Rain occurs when cloud droplets grow large enough to fall to the earth's surface. In the early stages of cloud formation, water droplets are extremely small and light, allowing them to remain suspended in the air. For rain to form, these droplets must increase in size. This happens through a process called coalescence, where droplets collide and merge to form larger drops. As droplets grow, they become heavier until gravity eventually pulls them toward the ground. The ultimate size of raindrops depends on several factors, including the height of the cloud and the conditions through which the drops fall.<br><br>(4) Different types of rainfall result from various cloud formation processes. Convective rainfall occurs when the sun heats the ground, causing warm air to rise rapidly and create tall cumulonimbus clouds. These often lead to heavy but short-lived showers. Orographic rainfall happens when moist air is forced to rise over mountains or hills, cooling as it ascends and creating clouds that release their moisture on the windward side. Frontal rainfall develops when warm and cold air masses meet, with the lighter warm air being forced to rise over the denser cold air, forming clouds along the front.<br><br>(5) Scientists use various tools to study cloud formation and predict rainfall. Weather balloons collect data on temperature and humidity at different atmospheric levels. Satellites provide a broader view of cloud patterns across large regions. Radar systems detect the movement and intensity of precipitation, allowing meteorologists to track storms. This thorough monitoring helps in developing accurate forecasts, which are essential for agriculture, water storage management, transportation, and emergency preparedness. Understanding the cycle of cloud formation and rainfall also helps researchers study climate patterns and how they might change in the future.",
