  "passage": "<br>(1) Technology has dramatically changed the way we work over the past few decades. Many jobs that once required manual labor are now performed by machines or computers. This shift has created both challenges and opportunities for workers around the world. While some traditional jobs have disappeared, new positions requiring different skills have emerged in their place.<br><br>(2) One of the most significant impacts of technology on the job market is automation. Factories that once employed hundreds of workers may now operate with just a few technicians overseeing automated systems. Similarly, administrative tasks that previously required full-time employees can now be completed using specialized software. As a result, workers in these fields must either adapt by learning new skills or find employment in different sectors.<br><br>(3) However, technological advancement has also created entire new industries. The growth of the internet has led to countless jobs in web development, digital marketing, and online customer service. Additionally, the rise of smartphones has spawned mobile app development as a profitable career path. These new fields often offer higher salaries and better working conditions than the jobs they have replaced.<br><br>(4) Education systems worldwide are responding to these changes by placing greater emphasis on digital literacy and technical skills. Schools and universities now teach coding, data analysis, and digital communication alongside traditional subjects. Furthermore, online learning platforms make it easier for working adults to acquire new skills without returning to formal education. This accessibility helps people remain competitive in a rapidly evolving job market.<br><br>(5) Looking ahead, experts predict that technology will continue to transform employment opportunities. Artificial intelligence and machine learning may automate more complex tasks, while virtual reality could create entirely new ways of working. The most successful workers will likely be those who can adapt quickly to changing conditions and continuously update their skills. Rather than fearing technological change, individuals should embrace it as an opportunity for growth and innovation in their careers.",
