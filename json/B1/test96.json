  "passage": "<br>(1) Credit cards and loans are common financial tools that allow people to borrow money for different purposes. Credit cards are plastic cards issued by banks that let users make purchases without using cash immediately. When someone uses a credit card, they are borrowing money from the card issuer with the promise to pay it back later. Most credit cards have a credit limit, which is the maximum amount a person can borrow.<br><br>(2) When credit card users don't pay their full balance by the due date, they must pay interest on the remaining amount. Interest is a percentage of the borrowed money that the lender charges as a fee for lending the money. Credit card interest rates are usually higher than other types of loans, often between 15% and 25% annually. This is why financial experts recommend paying off credit card balances in full each month.<br><br>(3) Loans work differently from credit cards. A loan is a fixed amount of money that a person borrows and agrees to pay back over a specific period. Common types of loans include personal loans, student loans, auto loans, and mortgages. When someone takes out a loan, they typically receive the entire amount at once and then make regular monthly payments until the loan is fully repaid.<br><br>(4) Most loans have fixed interest rates, meaning the rate stays the same throughout the loan term. Some loans, however, have variable interest rates that can change based on market conditions. The interest rate for a loan is usually determined by factors such as the borrower's credit score, income, and the amount of money being borrowed. People with higher credit scores generally qualify for loans with lower interest rates.<br><br>(5) Both credit cards and loans can be useful financial tools when used responsibly. They can help people make important purchases, manage emergencies, or build credit history. However, they can also lead to financial problems if not managed properly. Taking on too much debt can result in high interest payments and damage to one's credit score. This is why it's important to understand how these financial products work before using them.",
