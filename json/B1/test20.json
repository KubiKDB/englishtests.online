  "passage": "<br>(1) Islands are fascinating geographical formations that can be found in oceans, seas, lakes, and rivers around the world. They are created through various natural processes, including volcanic activity, tectonic plate movement, and the accumulation of sediment. Volcanic islands form when underwater volcanoes erupt and build up layers of lava that eventually rise above the water's surface. Other islands are created when pieces of continental land break off due to tectonic activity or when rising sea levels isolate areas of higher ground.<br><br>(2) Once an island forms, it begins to develop its own unique ecosystem. The isolation of islands from mainland areas creates conditions for distinctive patterns of plant and animal life to evolve. Species that reach these isolated landmasses, either by flying, swimming, or floating on debris, often adapt to their new environment over time. This process of adaptation can lead to the development of species that exist nowhere else on Earth, a phenomenon known as endemism. The Galapagos Islands, for example, are famous for their high number of endemic species that helped Charles Darwin formulate his theory of evolution.<br><br>(3) The size and distance of an island from the mainland significantly influence its biodiversity. Generally, larger islands can support more diverse ecosystems than smaller ones because they offer a greater variety of habitats and resources. Islands located closer to continents typically host more species than remote ones, as they are more accessible to plants and animals from the mainland. However, this proximity can also make them more vulnerable to invasive species, which can disrupt the delicate balance of island ecosystems.<br><br>(4) Climate plays a crucial role in shaping island ecosystems as well. Tropical islands often support lush rainforests and diverse coral reefs in their surrounding waters, while islands in colder regions may feature tundra or coniferous forest habitats. The unique climate conditions on islands, influenced by their size, shape, and location, can create microclimates that further enhance biological diversity. For instance, mountains on islands can create rain shadows, resulting in dramatically different environments on opposite sides of the island.<br><br>(5) Unfortunately, island ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to human activities and environmental changes. Their limited size and isolation make them less resilient to disturbances such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. The introduction of non-native species by humans has led to the extinction of numerous island species throughout history. Conservation efforts are now focused on protecting these unique ecosystems, which not only harbor exceptional biodiversity but also provide valuable insights into evolutionary processes and can serve as indicators of global environmental health.",
