  "passage": "<br>(1) The discovery of the Americas by Europeans is often attributed to Christopher Columbus, who sailed across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492. While Columbus is widely recognized for establishing contact between the Eastern and Western hemispheres, the first Europeans to reach North America were actually Viking explorers led by Leif Erikson around 1000 CE. However, Columbus's voyages had a more profound and lasting impact, as they led to permanent European colonization and dramatically changed the course of world history.<br><br>(2) Christopher Columbus, an Italian explorer sponsored by the Spanish monarchy, set sail with three ships—the Niña, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria—to find a western route to Asia. Instead, on October 12, 1492, he landed on an island in the Bahamas, which he claimed for Spain. Columbus made four voyages to the Americas, believing until his death that he had reached the East Indies rather than a previously unknown continent. This misconception led to the indigenous peoples of the Americas being called \"Indians,\" a term that persists in some contexts today.<br><br>(3) Following Columbus's initial voyages, other European explorers and conquistadors quickly followed. Spain's Hernán Cortés conquered the Aztec Empire in present-day Mexico between 1519 and 1521, while Francisco Pizarro overthrew the Inca Empire in Peru in the 1530s. Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral reached Brazil in 1500, claiming it for Portugal. Meanwhile, John Cabot, sailing for England, explored the coastline of North America in 1497, and French explorer Jacques Cartier mapped the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the St. Lawrence River in the 1530s.<br><br>(4) The European discovery of the Americas had profound consequences for both the Old and New Worlds. Europeans gained access to new crops such as corn, potatoes, tomatoes, and chocolate, which significantly improved their nutrition and population growth. They also acquired vast resources of gold and silver, particularly from Spanish conquests in Mexico and Peru. However, the impact on indigenous populations was devastating. European diseases such as smallpox, measles, and influenza, to which Native Americans had no immunity, caused catastrophic population declines estimated at 80-95% in many areas.<br><br>(5) The discovery also initiated the Columbian Exchange, a widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the Americas, Europe, and Africa. This exchange transformed agriculture globally and led to significant changes in world trade patterns. Additionally, the European colonization that followed Columbus's voyages established the foundations for several modern nations in the Americas and initiated centuries of cultural and genetic mixing. The historical impact of this encounter between worlds continues to shape our cultural, political, and economic realities today.",
