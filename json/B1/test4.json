  "passage": "<br>(1) The human eye is a remarkable organ that allows us to see the world in color. When light enters our eyes, it passes through the cornea and lens before reaching the retina at the back of our eye. The retina contains two types of light-sensitive cells: rods and cones. While rods help us see in dim light, cones are responsible for color vision.<br><br>(2) There are three types of cone cells in our eyes, and each type responds to different wavelengths of light. Some cones are most sensitive to red light, others to green light, and the third type to blue light. When light hits these cones, they send signals to our brain through the optic nerve. Our brain then interprets these signals as different colors, allowing us to perceive the vibrant world around us.<br><br>(3) The colors we see depend on the wavelengths of light that objects reflect. For example, a red apple appears red because it absorbs all wavelengths of light except red, which it reflects back to our eyes. Black objects absorb all wavelengths of light, while white objects reflect all wavelengths. This is why wearing black clothes on a sunny day makes you feel hotter than wearing white clothes, as black absorbs more light energy.<br><br>(4) Sometimes, people have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors, a condition known as color blindness. This usually happens when one or more types of cone cells don't work properly. The most common form of color blindness makes it hard to tell the difference between red and green. Color blindness is often inherited and is more common in males than females.<br><br>(5) Our perception of color can also be influenced by surrounding colors and lighting conditions. For instance, a gray object might appear slightly bluish when placed next to something yellow. Additionally, the same object may look different under natural sunlight compared to artificial indoor lighting. This is why interior designers and artists pay careful attention to lighting when working with colors.",
