  "passage": "<br>(1) Rainbows are one of nature's most spectacular light shows that occur when sunlight and water droplets meet in the atmosphere. A rainbow forms when sunlight enters a water droplet, slows down, and bends, or refracts. The light then reflects off the inside of the droplet and exits, separating into the different colors we see. This natural phenomenon requires specific conditions: sunlight, water droplets in the air, and the viewer positioned with their back to the sun.<br><br>(2) The science behind rainbows begins with understanding that white light from the sun is actually composed of all the colors of the visible spectrum. When this light passes through a water droplet, each color bends at a slightly different angle because each color has a different wavelength. Red light has the longest wavelength and bends the least, while violet has the shortest wavelength and bends the most. This separation of colors is called dispersion and is what creates the distinctive band of colors in a rainbow.<br><br>(3) The traditional rainbow displays seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors always appear in the same order because of their different wavelengths. When conditions are perfect, observers may see a double rainbow. The secondary rainbow forms when light reflects twice inside water droplets, causing the colors to appear in reverse order and making the secondary bow fainter than the primary one. The area between the two rainbows often appears darker, a phenomenon known as Alexander's dark band.<br><br>(4) Light itself is a form of electromagnetic radiation that travels in waves. These waves move at an incredible speed—approximately 186,000 miles per second in a vacuum. When light travels through different materials, such as water or glass, it slows down and can change direction. This change in direction is what causes the bending, or refraction, that is essential to rainbow formation. The same principle explains why a pencil appears to bend when placed in a glass of water.<br><br>(5) Understanding rainbows has practical applications beyond appreciating their beauty. Scientists use similar principles of light refraction and dispersion in many technologies, from optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes to fiber optic communications. The study of light behavior has led to advances in fields ranging from astronomy to medicine. For instance, spectroscopy—analyzing how matter interacts with light—helps scientists identify elements in distant stars, examine blood samples, and develop new materials with specific properties.",
