  "passage": "<br>(1) World War II brought unprecedented changes to women's roles in society. Before the war, most women in Western countries were expected to be homemakers, but the large-scale mobilization of men for military service created significant labor shortages in factories, farms, and offices. As a result, millions of women entered the workforce for the first time, taking on jobs previously considered suitable only for men.<br><br>(2) In the United States, the iconic image of 'Rosie the Riveter' symbolized the six million women who worked in manufacturing plants producing military supplies and equipment. These women assembled aircraft, built ships, manufactured ammunition, and operated heavy machinery. In Britain, women served in the Women's Land Army, maintaining the nation's food supply by working on farms. They also worked in munitions factories, drove buses, operated anti-aircraft guns, and served as air raid wardens.<br><br>(3) Women also played vital roles in military service during the war. In the United States, more than 350,000 women joined the armed forces in groups such as the Women's Army Corps (WAC) and the Navy's Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES). They worked as nurses, clerks, radio operators, and pilots, freeing men for combat roles. In the Soviet Union, women even served as combat pilots, snipers, and tank crew members, directly participating in fighting against Nazi forces.<br><br>(4) The war also created significant challenges for women on the home front. With husbands and fathers away fighting, women became the heads of households, managing finances and making important family decisions alone. They dealt with rationing, raised children as single parents, and endured the constant worry about loved ones in danger. Many women also participated in volunteer work, organizing community support, collecting supplies for troops, and helping with civil defense.<br><br>(5) When the war ended in 1945, many women were forced to leave their jobs to make room for returning veterans. However, their wartime experiences had demonstrated their capabilities beyond traditional roles, helping to challenge gender stereotypes and laying groundwork for future women's movements. The seeds of change planted during World War II eventually contributed to the significant social transformations of the later 20th century, as women increasingly sought equal opportunities in education, employment, and politics.",
