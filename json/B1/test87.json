  "passage": "<br>(1) Inflation is an economic concept that refers to the general increase in prices of goods and services over time, resulting in a decrease in the purchasing power of money. When inflation occurs, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services than it did previously. This phenomenon is typically measured as an annual percentage increase in prices, with common measurements including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).<br><br>(2) There are several causes of inflation. Demand-pull inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds aggregate supply, causing prices to rise as consumers compete for limited goods. Cost-push inflation happens when production costs increase, such as rising wages or raw material costs, forcing businesses to raise prices to maintain profit margins. Monetary inflation results from an increase in the money supply that outpaces economic growth, leading to too much money chasing too few goods.<br><br>(3) The effects of inflation on consumers are primarily seen through decreased purchasing power. As prices rise, consumers can buy fewer goods and services with the same amount of money. This often leads to changes in spending habits, with people prioritizing essential items and cutting back on luxuries. Fixed-income individuals, like retirees, are particularly vulnerable to inflation as their income may not increase while their expenses do.<br><br>(4) For businesses, inflation creates both challenges and opportunities. Companies must navigate increasing costs for materials, labor, and operations, which can squeeze profit margins if they cannot pass these costs on to consumers. However, businesses with pricing power may be able to increase their prices faster than their costs rise, potentially increasing profits. Additionally, inflation can complicate long-term planning and investment decisions due to increased uncertainty.<br><br>(5) Governments and central banks employ various strategies to manage inflation. Central banks typically use monetary policy tools such as adjusting interest rates to control inflation. When inflation rises above target levels, central banks may increase interest rates to reduce spending and borrowing, thereby cooling economic activity. Conversely, when inflation is too low, they might lower interest rates to stimulate economic growth. Finding the right balance is crucial, as high inflation can erode purchasing power and economic stability, while very low inflation or deflation can indicate economic stagnation.",
