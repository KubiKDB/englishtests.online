  "passage": "<br>(1) Temperature changes with elevation in our atmosphere in a phenomenon known as the lapse rate. As one climbs higher up a mountain or travels in an aircraft to higher altitudes, the temperature generally decreases. This relationship between elevation and temperature plays a crucial role in many atmospheric processes and affects climate patterns worldwide.<br><br>(2) On average, temperature decreases by about 6.5 degrees Celsius for every 1,000 meters of elevation gain. This occurs because air pressure decreases with height, causing the air to expand and cool. This cooling effect explains why mountain peaks remain snow-covered even in summer months, while valleys at lower elevations experience much warmer conditions.<br><br>(3) However, temperature inversions can sometimes disrupt this pattern. An inversion occurs when warm air sits above cooler air, reversing the normal temperature gradient. These inversions often happen in valleys during winter, when cold air flows downhill and becomes trapped beneath warmer air above. People living in valley towns may experience colder temperatures than those residing higher up the slopes.<br><br>(4) Elevation affects temperature differently depending on location and season. In tropical regions, the cooling effect of elevation creates distinct climate zones within short distances. This allows for diverse agriculture, where crops that would normally grow in temperate regions can be cultivated at higher elevations near the equator. Many coffee plantations, for example, occupy the middle elevations of tropical mountains where temperatures are ideal.<br><br>(5) Understanding the relationship between elevation and temperature has proven important for many fields, from agriculture to urban planning. Mountain communities must budget for heating costs differently than coastal areas, and building designs must account for temperature variations at different elevations. Climate scientists also study this relationship to better predict how global warming might affect different regions based on their topography.",
