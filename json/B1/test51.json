  "passage": "<br>(1) Hibernation is a fascinating process that many animals undergo to survive the harsh winter months. During hibernation, animals enter a state similar to a very deep sleep where their body temperature drops, their breathing slows down, and their metabolic rate decreases significantly. This allows them to conserve energy when food sources are scarce and temperatures are too cold for them to maintain their normal activities.<br><br>(2) Different animals hibernate in different ways. Bears, for example, enter a light hibernation state where their body temperature drops only slightly, and they can wake up relatively quickly if disturbed. In contrast, small mammals like ground squirrels and hedgehogs experience a much deeper hibernation, with body temperatures dropping close to freezing and heart rates slowing dramatically to just a few beats per minute.<br><br>(3) Preparation for hibernation begins in late summer or early fall when animals start eating more food than usual. This behavior, called hyperphagia, helps them build up fat reserves that will sustain them throughout their dormant period. Some hibernators, like chipmunks and squirrels, also store food in their dens or burrows to eat during brief periods of wakefulness during the winter.<br><br>(4) The timing of hibernation is controlled by various environmental cues such as decreasing daylight hours, dropping temperatures, and changes in food availability. These signals trigger hormonal changes in the animals' bodies that prepare them for the long sleep ahead. Most hibernators find or create a sheltered den, burrow, or cave where they will be protected from predators and extreme weather conditions.<br><br>(5) While hibernation is often associated with mammals, some other animals have similar adaptations. Certain frogs and turtles can survive being partially frozen during winter, while some insects produce natural antifreeze compounds in their bodies. Some birds, like the common poorwill, can enter a state of torpor (a lighter form of hibernation) for weeks at a time. These various adaptations show how animals have evolved different strategies to cope with seasonal changes in their environments.",
