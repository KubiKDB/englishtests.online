  "passage": "<br>(1) The heart is a powerful muscular organ that serves as the central pump of the circulatory system. Located in the chest between the lungs, this fist-sized organ beats approximately 100,000 times per day, pumping about 7,500 liters of blood throughout the body. The heart is divided into four chambers: two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. A wall of muscle called the septum separates the left and right sides of the heart, preventing oxygen-rich blood from mixing with oxygen-poor blood.<br><br>(2) The primary function of the heart is to maintain a continuous circulation of blood throughout the body. This circulation delivers essential oxygen and nutrients to all cells while removing waste products such as carbon dioxide. The heart performs this vital function through a coordinated sequence of contractions and relaxations that moves blood in a one-way flow through the circulatory system. This rhythmic pumping action is controlled by electrical signals that originate from a natural pacemaker called the sinoatrial node, located in the right atrium.<br><br>(3) Blood circulation follows a specific pathway through the heart and body. First, oxygen-depleted blood returns from the body through large veins called the superior and inferior vena cavae, entering the right atrium. The blood then flows through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle. When the heart contracts, this blood is pumped through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary arteries, which carry it to the lungs where it releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen. The newly oxygenated blood then returns to the heart through the pulmonary veins, entering the left atrium.<br><br>(4) From the left atrium, the oxygen-rich blood passes through the mitral valve into the left ventricle, which is the heart's most powerful chamber. When the left ventricle contracts, it forces the blood through the aortic valve into the aorta, the body's largest artery. From there, the blood travels through a network of increasingly smaller arteries and arterioles until it reaches the capillaries, where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products occurs at the cellular level. After this exchange, the oxygen-depleted blood returns to the heart through venules and veins, completing the cycle.<br><br>(5) The heart's ability to function properly is essential for overall health. Various factors can affect heart performance, including diet, exercise, stress, and hereditary conditions. Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, often resulting from lifestyle factors such as poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption. Regular physical activity, a balanced diet, stress management, and routine medical check-ups can help maintain heart health and prevent cardiovascular problems. Medical advances have also provided treatments for many heart conditions, including medications, surgical procedures, and implantable devices that can help the heart function more effectively.",
