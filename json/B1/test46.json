  "passage": "<br>(1) Metals are excellent conductors of electricity, a property that makes them essential in our modern world. When we flip a switch to turn on a light or plug in a device, electricity flows through metal wires to power our homes and gadgets. But have you ever wondered why metals conduct electricity so well while materials like plastic or wood do not?<br><br>(2) To understand why metals conduct electricity, we need to look at their atomic structure. All metals have a specific arrangement of atoms where the outermost electrons are loosely held. These electrons, often called 'free electrons' or 'conduction electrons,' are not tightly bound to any particular atom. Instead, they form what scientists describe as an 'electron sea' that flows throughout the entire metal.<br><br>(3) When we apply an electric voltage to a piece of metal, these free electrons begin to move in a specific direction. This organized movement of electrons is what we call an electric current. The more freely these electrons can move, the better the metal conducts electricity. Some metals, like copper and silver, have particularly mobile electrons, making them excellent conductors used in electrical wiring and circuits.<br><br>(4) Temperature also affects how well metals conduct electricity. Generally, as temperature increases, metals become less effective conductors. This happens because the atoms vibrate more at higher temperatures, creating more obstacles for the moving electrons. This property is why some electronic devices may overheat and stop working properly if they get too hot.<br><br>(5) Understanding the conductive properties of metals has allowed engineers to develop better electrical systems and electronic devices. By selecting the right metals for specific applications, we can create more efficient electrical grids, faster computers, and more reliable electronic equipment. The remarkable ability of metals to conduct electricity has become fundamental to our technological progress.",
