  "passage": "<br>(1) Simple machines are devices that make work easier by changing the direction or magnitude of a force. There are six basic types of simple machines: the lever, the wheel and axle, the pulley, the inclined plane, the wedge, and the screw. These fundamental tools have been used for thousands of years and continue to form the basis of many complex machines we use today. Despite technological advances, the principles behind simple machines remain unchanged and are essential to our daily lives.<br><br>(2) The lever is perhaps the most common simple machine, consisting of a rigid beam that pivots on a fixed point called a fulcrum. We use levers every day when we open doors, cut with scissors, or remove bottle caps with openers. Similarly, the wheel and axle combination—essentially a modified lever—revolutionized transportation and appears in countless applications from car tires to doorknobs. Pulleys, which use wheels and ropes to lift heavy objects, are found in elevators, construction cranes, and even in the mechanisms that raise and lower window blinds.<br><br>(3) Inclined planes are sloped surfaces that make it easier to move objects to a higher or lower position. Instead of lifting an object straight up, we can push it along a gentler slope, reducing the required force. Ramps for wheelchairs and loading trucks are common examples of inclined planes. The wedge, a portable inclined plane with at least one sloping side, transforms force applied to its blunt end into forces perpendicular to its inclined surfaces. Knives, axes, and doorstops are all practical applications of wedges in everyday life.<br><br>(4) The screw, essentially an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder, converts rotational force into linear motion. This simple machine appears in countless forms, from wood screws and bolts to spiral staircases and even certain kitchen gadgets like meat grinders. The threads of a screw allow for mechanical advantage, meaning a small rotational force can create a much larger linear force—perfect for fastening objects together or lifting heavy loads with devices like car jacks.<br><br>(5) Many modern tools and appliances combine multiple simple machines to create more complex mechanisms. For instance, a bicycle uses wheels, axles, pulleys (in the chain and gears), and levers (in the brakes and pedals). Even sophisticated devices like automobiles and industrial equipment rely on these fundamental principles. By understanding how simple machines work, we gain insight into the mechanics of our technological world and appreciate how these ancient innovations continue to shape modern convenience.",
