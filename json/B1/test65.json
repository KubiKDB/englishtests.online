  "passage": "<br>(1) The history of the steam engine began in the early 18th century with Thomas Newcomen, an English inventor who developed the first practical steam engine in 1712. His invention was primarily used to pump water out of coal mines. The Newcomen engine was a simple but effective machine that used steam pressure and atmospheric pressure to move a piston up and down inside a cylinder.<br><br>(2) However, it was James Watt, a Scottish engineer, who truly revolutionized the steam engine. In 1769, Watt patented a design for a steam engine with a separate condenser. This innovation greatly improved the efficiency of steam engines, as the cylinder no longer needed to be heated and cooled with each cycle. Watt's improved design used about 75% less coal than Newcomen's engine while delivering more power.<br><br>(3) The impact of these improved steam engines was enormous. They quickly became the primary power source for the Industrial Revolution, transforming manufacturing, transportation, and mining. Factories could now be built anywhere, not just near sources of water power. This led to rapid industrialization across Europe and North America, changing the economic and social landscape forever.<br><br>(4) By the early 19th century, steam engines were being adapted for transportation. In 1804, Richard Trevithick built the first full-scale working railway steam locomotive. Steam-powered ships also began to appear, with the first commercially successful steamboat, the Clermont, built by Robert Fulton in 1807. These developments revolutionized how people and goods could move across continents and oceans.<br><br>(5) The steam engine remained the dominant source of power in industry and transportation until the early 20th century, when it was gradually replaced by electric motors and internal combustion engines. Nevertheless, the principles behind the steam engine continue to influence modern power generation, and its historical significance cannot be overstated. The steam engine not only powered the Industrial Revolution but also fundamentally changed human society, setting the stage for our modern world.",
