  "passage": "<br>(1) Mountain ranges play a crucial role in shaping weather patterns around the world. When air encounters a mountain range, it is forced to rise, cool, and often release moisture in the form of rain or snow. This phenomenon, known as orographic lifting, creates distinct weather conditions on different sides of mountains. The side facing the prevailing winds, called the windward side, typically receives heavy precipitation as moisture-laden air rises and cools. This explains why many mountain slopes feature lush forests and abundant vegetation.<br><br>(2) In contrast, the opposite side of a mountain range, known as the leeward side, often experiences much drier conditions. After releasing moisture on the windward side, the air descends, warms, and becomes relatively dry. This creates what meteorologists call a rain shadow effect. Some of the world's most notable deserts, including the Gobi Desert in Asia and parts of Nevada and Utah in the United States, exist primarily because nearby mountain ranges block moisture from reaching these areas.<br><br>(3) Mountain ranges also influence temperature patterns in significant ways. Air temperature typically decreases with elevation, with average temperatures dropping about 6.5°C for every 1,000 meters of height. This creates vertical climate zones where different types of vegetation and wildlife thrive at various elevations. Additionally, mountains can block cold air masses, protecting regions from severe winter conditions. For example, the Alps shield parts of southern Europe from cold Arctic air masses, helping to maintain milder winter temperatures.<br><br>(4) The impact of mountains on wind patterns is equally important. Mountain ranges can channel winds in specific directions, creating corridor effects where winds are accelerated between peaks or through valleys. These localized wind patterns often have specific names in different regions, such as the Mistral in southern France or the Santa Ana winds in California. Such winds can significantly influence local temperatures, humidity levels, and even air quality in nearby communities.<br><br>(5) On a larger scale, major mountain ranges can affect global atmospheric circulation patterns. The Himalayas, the world's highest mountain range, influence the South Asian monsoon system that brings seasonal rainfall to millions of people. Similarly, the Rocky Mountains in North America affect continental weather systems by redirecting air masses and storm tracks. As climate change continues to alter temperature and precipitation patterns worldwide, understanding how mountains influence weather becomes increasingly important for predicting future climate conditions and preparing for environmental changes.",
