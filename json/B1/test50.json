  "passage": "<br>(1) Energy is essential for modern life, powering everything from homes and transportation to industries and technology. Energy sources are generally classified into two main categories: renewable and non-renewable. These different types of energy have significant impacts on our environment, economy, and future sustainability. Understanding the differences between them is crucial as the world faces growing energy demands and environmental challenges.<br><br>(2) Non-renewable energy sources include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, as well as nuclear energy. These sources formed over millions of years and exist in limited quantities on Earth. Once consumed, they cannot be replaced within a human lifetime. For decades, these sources have dominated global energy production due to their reliability, high energy output, and established infrastructure. However, they present serious drawbacks, including the release of greenhouse gases when burned, contribution to air and water pollution, and the inevitable problem of eventual depletion.<br><br>(3) Renewable energy, in contrast, comes from natural sources that replenish themselves relatively quickly. Solar energy harnesses power from the sun, while wind energy captures the kinetic energy of moving air. Hydropower utilizes flowing water, biomass energy comes from organic materials, and geothermal energy taps into Earth's internal heat. These sources offer significant environmental advantages as they produce minimal pollution and greenhouse gases during operation. Additionally, they represent inexhaustible energy supplies that will not run out as long as their natural sources exist.<br><br>(4) The transition from non-renewable to renewable energy presents both challenges and opportunities. Renewable technologies often require substantial initial investments, though operational costs typically decrease over time. Intermittency can be an issue, as solar and wind power depend on weather conditions. Energy storage systems and improved grid management are being developed to address these limitations. Despite these challenges, renewable energy capacity has grown dramatically in recent years as technology improves and costs decline, making these sources increasingly competitive with conventional fuels.<br><br>(5) The future energy landscape will likely feature a mix of sources, with renewables playing an increasingly dominant role. Many countries have established ambitious targets for renewable energy adoption and carbon emission reductions. Technological innovations continue to enhance efficiency and reduce costs for clean energy options. Individual consumers also have growing opportunities to participate in this transition through home solar installations, energy-efficient appliances, and support for clean energy policies. The shift toward sustainable energy represents one of the most significant global transformations of the 21st century, with profound implications for economies, environments, and societies worldwide.",
