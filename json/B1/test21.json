  "passage": "<br>(1) The Great Wall of China is one of the most impressive structures ever built by humans. Stretching over 13,000 miles across northern China, this massive defensive wall was constructed over many centuries by different Chinese dynasties. While many people know about its impressive size, fewer understand the true reasons behind its construction.<br><br>(2) The primary purpose of the Great Wall was defense. Ancient China faced constant threats from nomadic tribes to the north, particularly the Xiongnu and later the Mongols. These groups would frequently raid Chinese settlements, stealing crops, livestock, and other valuable resources. The wall served as a physical barrier to slow down these invasions and give Chinese forces time to respond.<br><br>(3) Beyond its military function, the Great Wall also played an important economic role. It helped to control trade routes and enforce customs duties on goods traveling along the Silk Road. Guard towers positioned along the wall served as checkpoints where merchants had to pay taxes on their goods. In this way, the wall not only protected China's borders but also generated revenue for the empire.<br><br>(4) The wall additionally served as a powerful symbol of Chinese civilization and imperial power. Successive emperors expanded and reinforced the wall to demonstrate their strength and authority. Building such a massive structure required enormous resources and labor, showing the emperor's ability to organize and control a vast workforce. Some historians estimate that up to one million people died during the wall's construction.<br><br>(5) Today, the Great Wall remains an enduring symbol of China's long history and cultural heritage. While it ultimately failed to prevent invasions completely, it successfully slowed many attacks and helped shape the development of Chinese civilization. The wall now attracts millions of tourists each year, who come to witness this remarkable achievement of human engineering and determination.",
