  "passage": "<br>(1) Democracy, which originated in ancient Greece around 500 BCE, has significantly influenced modern governmental systems worldwide. The word \"democracy\" comes from the Greek words \"demos\" (people) and \"kratos\" (power), literally meaning \"power of the people.\" In ancient Athens, citizens would gather in the Agora to debate and vote on important matters affecting their city-state. This direct participation in decision-making processes represented a revolutionary approach to governance that challenged the prevailing monarchical and aristocratic systems of the time.<br><br>(2) One of the most important contributions of Greek democracy to modern governments is the concept of citizenship with equal rights. In Athens, all citizens (though limited to free adult males) had the right to speak in the assembly, vote on legislation, and participate in the judicial system. This fundamental principle of political equality among citizens forms the cornerstone of modern democratic systems. Today, most democratic nations extend these rights to all adult citizens regardless of gender, property ownership, or social status, representing an evolution of the original Greek concept.<br><br>(3) The separation of powers, another crucial element in modern democracies, also finds its roots in Greek political thought. Although not formally structured as in today's governments, ancient Athens had different institutions that performed various functions: the Assembly (legislative), magistrates (executive), and the courts (judicial). Philosophers like Aristotle discussed the importance of balanced governance, an idea later developed by thinkers such as Montesquieu and incorporated into many modern constitutions, most notably that of the United States with its three branches of government.<br><br>(4) Representative democracy, the predominant form in modern nations, differs from the direct democracy practiced in ancient Athens. Due to larger populations and geographical constraints, modern democracies typically elect representatives who make decisions on behalf of their constituents. However, the fundamental Greek principle that government should be responsive to its citizens remains central. Many modern governments incorporate elements of direct democracy through referendums and initiatives, allowing citizens to vote directly on specific issues, thus preserving some aspects of the Athenian model.<br><br>(5) Despite these connections, modern democratic systems have evolved significantly from their Greek predecessors. Contemporary democracies typically include constitutional protections for individual rights, extensive bureaucracies, and complex electoral systems—all developments beyond the Athenian model. Additionally, modern democracies have had to address challenges unknown to the ancient Greeks, such as managing diverse multicultural populations and responding to globalization. Nevertheless, the core principle established by the Greeks—that legitimate political authority stems from the governed—continues to inspire democratic movements and governments around the world.",
