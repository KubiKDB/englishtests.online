  "passage": "<br>(1) The Arctic and Antarctic regions, located at the northernmost and southernmost parts of our planet respectively, are two of Earth's most extreme environments. Despite both being characterized by frigid temperatures and icy landscapes, these polar regions differ significantly in their geographical features. The Arctic is primarily a frozen ocean surrounded by continental landmasses and islands, while the Antarctic is a continent itself, covered by an immense ice sheet and surrounded entirely by the Southern Ocean.<br><br>(2) The Arctic region encompasses the area around the North Pole, including parts of Canada, Russia, the United States (Alaska), Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Greenland. Unlike its southern counterpart, the Arctic has no permanent land at its center, just sea ice that expands in winter and contracts in summer. This region is home to diverse wildlife including polar bears, seals, and various bird species, as well as indigenous human populations who have adapted to the harsh conditions over thousands of years. The temperature in the Arctic can range from around -40°C in winter to 10°C in summer in some areas.<br><br>(3) The Antarctic, centered on the South Pole, presents a starkly different geographical profile. It is the fifth-largest continent, with 98% of its land mass covered by ice averaging 1.9 kilometers in thickness. No indigenous human population exists in Antarctica; instead, the continent hosts researchers from various countries at scientific stations. The wildlife in Antarctica is primarily found in coastal areas and includes penguins, seals, and various marine species. Antarctic temperatures are significantly colder than the Arctic, with winter averages around -60°C and summer temperatures rarely rising above 0°C even in coastal areas.<br><br>(4) Both polar regions play crucial roles in Earth's climate system. The vast ice sheets reflect solar radiation back into space, helping to regulate global temperatures. As these regions warm due to climate change, the melting ice contributes to rising sea levels worldwide. The Arctic is warming at nearly twice the global average rate, leading to reduced sea ice coverage, which further accelerates warming as darker ocean water absorbs more solar radiation than reflective ice—a phenomenon known as the ice-albedo feedback loop.<br><br>(5) The governance of these regions also differs considerably. The Arctic is subject to the territorial claims and economic interests of the nations that border it, though international cooperation exists through the Arctic Council. Antarctica, however, is governed under the Antarctic Treaty System, which designates the continent as a scientific preserve and prohibits military activities, mineral mining, and territorial claims. This unique international agreement has fostered scientific collaboration in one of Earth's most remote and challenging environments, making Antarctica a model for global cooperation.",
