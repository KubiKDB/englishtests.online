  "passage": "<br>(1) Air pollution is a growing problem that affects millions of people around the world. It occurs when harmful substances are released into the air, including gases, particles, and biological molecules. These pollutants come from various sources such as factories, vehicles, power plants, and even household products. While some air pollution is visible as smoke or smog, many dangerous pollutants are invisible to the naked eye.<br><br>(2) The health effects of air pollution can be both short-term and long-term. In the short term, exposure to polluted air can cause irritation to the eyes, nose, and throat, as well as headaches, dizziness, and fatigue. People with pre-existing conditions like asthma or heart disease may experience worsening symptoms when air quality is poor. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to these immediate effects.<br><br>(3) Long-term exposure to air pollution has been linked to more serious health problems. Research has shown that living in areas with high levels of air pollution increases the risk of respiratory diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema. Studies have also found connections between air pollution and heart disease, with pollutants potentially causing inflammation and narrowing of blood vessels. Additionally, there is growing evidence that air pollution may contribute to the development of certain types of cancer.<br><br>(4) The World Health Organization estimates that air pollution is responsible for millions of premature deaths each year. In urban areas, where pollution levels tend to be highest, the impact on public health can be significant. The economic costs are also substantial, including increased healthcare expenses, reduced productivity due to illness, and days missed from work or school. These costs affect not only individuals but also society as a whole.<br><br>(5) Fortunately, there are steps that can be taken to reduce air pollution and its effects on human health. Governments can implement stricter regulations on emissions from industries and vehicles. Individuals can help by using public transportation, carpooling, or choosing cleaner energy sources for their homes. Monitoring air quality and staying indoors on particularly polluted days can also help reduce exposure. By working together, we can improve air quality and protect public health for current and future generations.",
