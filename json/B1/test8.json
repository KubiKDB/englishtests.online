  "passage": "<br>(1) The Earth's atmosphere is a complex layer of gases that surrounds our planet and makes life possible. This protective blanket extends from the Earth's surface to approximately 10,000 kilometers above, gradually thinning with increasing altitude until it eventually merges with outer space. The atmosphere is held in place by Earth's gravity and is composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with the remaining 1% consisting of argon, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and trace gases. This composition has evolved over billions of years and plays a crucial role in maintaining the temperatures and conditions necessary for life.<br><br>(2) Scientists divide the atmosphere into five distinct layers based on temperature variations and composition. The troposphere is the lowest layer, extending from the Earth's surface to approximately 8-15 kilometers up, depending on location and season. This is where we live and where nearly all weather phenomena occur. The troposphere contains about 75% of the atmosphere's mass and almost all of its water vapor. One of its defining characteristics is that temperature decreases with height, dropping about 6.5°C for every kilometer of altitude, until reaching the tropopause, which marks the boundary with the next layer.<br><br>(3) Above the troposphere lies the stratosphere, which extends to about 50 kilometers above Earth. Unlike the troposphere, temperature in this layer actually increases with altitude due to the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer. This ozone concentration, found primarily within the stratosphere, shields Earth's surface from harmful solar radiation. The steady temperature gradient and lack of vertical air movement make the stratosphere ideal for aircraft to fly in, as it offers much less turbulence than the troposphere below.<br><br>(4) The mesosphere extends from the stratosphere to approximately 85 kilometers above Earth and is characterized by extremely low temperatures, reaching as cold as -90°C at its upper boundary. In this layer, temperature once again decreases with altitude. The mesosphere is where most meteors burn up upon entering Earth's atmosphere, creating the streaks of light we call shooting stars. Despite its importance, the mesosphere remains one of the least understood layers because it is too high for aircraft but too low for satellites to operate in, making it difficult to study directly.<br><br>(5) The final two layers are the thermosphere and the exosphere. The thermosphere extends from about 85 to 600 kilometers above Earth and experiences a rapid temperature increase with altitude, potentially reaching 2,000°C. However, this heat would not feel hot to humans because the air molecules are so far apart. The International Space Station orbits within this layer. Beyond the thermosphere lies the exosphere, the outermost layer where the atmosphere gradually thins and transitions into outer space. This boundary region is where many weather and communication satellites orbit Earth. Together, these five atmospheric layers protect our planet from harmful radiation, regulate temperature, and make Earth the habitable planet we know today.",
