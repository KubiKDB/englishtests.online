  "passage": "<br>(1) Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms that exist in different ecosystems around the world. This includes the diversity of species, genetics, and ecosystems. Every plant, animal, fungus, and microorganism plays a unique role in maintaining the balance of nature. When biodiversity is high, ecosystems are generally more stable and resilient to environmental changes.<br><br>(2) One of the most important functions of biodiversity is providing ecosystem services. These services include nutrient cycling, soil formation, water purification, and climate regulation. For example, forests help clean the air and regulate rainfall patterns, while wetlands filter water and prevent flooding. Marine ecosystems like coral reefs protect coastlines from storms and erosion. All these services are essential for human survival and well-being.<br><br>(3) Biodiversity also supports food security and human health. Many medicines come from natural sources, and scientists continue to discover new medicinal properties in plants and animals. Agricultural biodiversity ensures we have a variety of crops that can withstand different conditions. Wild relatives of domesticated crops contain genetic diversity that can help develop more resistant varieties in the face of climate change and new diseases.<br><br>(4) Despite its importance, biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate due to human activities. Habitat destruction, pollution, overexploitation, invasive species, and climate change are the major threats. When species become extinct, their unique contributions to ecosystems are lost forever. This can trigger a cascade of effects throughout the food web, potentially leading to ecosystem collapse if key species are removed.<br><br>(5) Protecting biodiversity requires action at local, national, and global levels. Conservation efforts include establishing protected areas, restoring degraded habitats, controlling invasive species, and reducing pollution. Sustainable use of natural resources ensures that ecosystems can continue to function while meeting human needs. By understanding the importance of biodiversity, we can make informed decisions that balance development with conservation for the benefit of current and future generations.",
