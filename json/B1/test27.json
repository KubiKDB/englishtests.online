  "passage": "<br>(1) Fossils form when plants and animals die and are quickly buried by sediment such as mud, sand, or volcanic ash. Over time, as more layers of sediment build up, the pressure turns the lower layers into rock. The soft parts of the organism decompose, but the hard parts like bones, teeth, and shells can leave impressions or become mineralized, creating fossils. This process usually takes thousands or even millions of years to complete.<br><br>(2) Several types of fossils exist, including body fossils, trace fossils, and chemical fossils. Body fossils preserve the actual remains of an organism, such as bones, shells, or leaves. Trace fossils record the activity of ancient organisms, like footprints, burrows, or nests. Chemical fossils are substances that provide indirect evidence of ancient life, such as the chemical signatures left behind by microorganisms in rocks.<br><br>(3) Paleontologists, scientists who study fossils, use them to understand what life was like in the past. Fossils can reveal information about an organism's appearance, behavior, diet, and environment. By studying fossils from different time periods, scientists can see how species have evolved over millions of years. Fossils also help scientists understand how ecosystems functioned in the past and how they responded to environmental changes.<br><br>(4) The age of fossils can be determined through various dating methods. Relative dating examines the position of fossils in rock layers, with deeper layers generally being older. Absolute dating uses techniques such as radiometric dating to determine the exact age of fossils. These methods allow scientists to create a timeline of Earth's history and place fossils in their correct historical context.<br><br>(5) Fossils have significantly contributed to our understanding of evolution and Earth's history. They provide evidence for major evolutionary transitions, such as the development of mammals from reptiles and the evolution of humans from earlier primates. Fossils also help scientists reconstruct ancient environments and climates, offering valuable insights into how our planet has changed over time. This knowledge is crucial for understanding current environmental challenges and predicting future changes to Earth's ecosystems.",
