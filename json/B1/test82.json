  "passage": "<br>(1) The Renaissance, a cultural movement that spanned roughly from the 14th to the 17th century, marked a period of significant transformation in European art and science. Beginning in Italy, this influential era brought about a renewed interest in classical learning and values that would forever change Western civilization.<br><br>(2) In the realm of art, Renaissance painters and sculptors broke away from medieval traditions. Artists like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael developed techniques such as linear perspective, realistic human anatomy, and chiaroscuro (the use of light and shadow). These innovations allowed artists to create more lifelike and three-dimensional representations, establishing new standards for beauty and realism.<br><br>(3) The Renaissance also witnessed remarkable advancements in architecture. Inspired by classical Roman designs, architects such as Filippo Brunelleschi created magnificent structures featuring domes, columns, and symmetrical proportions. The Florence Cathedral's dome, completed in 1436, stands as a testament to both artistic vision and technical achievement of the period.<br><br>(4) Scientific inquiry flourished during the Renaissance as scholars began to examine the natural world through observation and experimentation rather than relying solely on ancient texts. Nicolaus Copernicus challenged the long-accepted geocentric model of the universe, proposing that the Earth revolves around the sun. Later, Galileo Galilei's telescopic observations provided evidence supporting this heliocentric view, fundamentally changing humanity's understanding of our place in the cosmos.<br><br>(5) Perhaps most importantly, the Renaissance embodied a spirit of humanism that placed value on human capabilities and achievements. This perspective encouraged individuals to pursue knowledge across multiple disciplines. The concept of the \"Renaissance man\" – exemplified by figures like Leonardo da Vinci who excelled in art, science, engineering, and more – reflects how this era celebrated human potential and curiosity. This interdisciplinary approach to learning established a foundation for modern education and continues to influence our understanding of knowledge today.",
