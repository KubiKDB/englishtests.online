  "passage": "<br>(1) Natural resources are unevenly distributed across the planet, leading to significant differences in resource wealth among countries. This uneven distribution is primarily due to geological processes that have occurred over millions of years. For instance, oil-rich nations like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela sit atop ancient seas where organic material was trapped and transformed into petroleum deposits, while countries like Japan have very limited fossil fuel reserves.<br><br>(2) Geography and climate also play crucial roles in determining a country's natural resource endowment. Nations with diverse topography often have more varied mineral deposits. Countries located in tropical regions typically have greater biodiversity and agricultural potential, while those with extensive coastlines have better access to marine resources. Climate patterns influence water availability, with some regions receiving abundant rainfall while others face persistent drought conditions.<br><br>(3) Tectonic activity further contributes to resource disparity. Countries situated along tectonic plate boundaries, such as Chile and Indonesia, often have rich mineral deposits due to volcanic activity that brings metals closer to the surface. In contrast, nations with stable geological platforms may have fewer accessible mineral resources but might possess fertile soil deposits ideal for agriculture.<br><br>(4) The size of a country is another determining factor in resource abundance. Larger nations like Russia, Canada, and Australia simply have more land area where resources can be found. These countries span diverse geological zones, increasing their chances of containing various mineral deposits, forests, and water resources. Smaller nations, particularly island states, are limited by their geographical boundaries regardless of geological fortune.<br><br>(5) Historical timing of geological events also matters significantly. Some regions experienced conditions perfect for coal formation during specific prehistoric periods, while others did not. Similarly, certain areas underwent the right combination of heat and pressure to create diamond deposits, gold veins, or rare earth elements, while neighboring regions with slightly different geological histories lack these valuable resources. This element of geological timing explains why some countries may have abundant reserves of one resource but little of another.",
