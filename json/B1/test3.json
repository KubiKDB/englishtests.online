  "passage": "<br>(1) The Amazon Rainforest is often called the \"lungs of the planet\" because it produces about 20% of the world's oxygen. Located in South America, it spans nine countries, with the majority of it being in Brazil. This incredible natural wonder covers approximately 5.5 million square kilometers, making it the largest tropical rainforest on Earth. The Amazon is home to the Amazon River, which is the second-longest river in the world and carries more water than any other river.<br><br>(2) The biodiversity found in the Amazon Rainforest is simply astonishing. Scientists have discovered over 40,000 plant species, 1,300 bird species, 3,000 types of fish, 427 mammals, and 2.5 million different insects in this vast ecosystem. Remarkably, new species are still being found regularly. Researchers estimate that only a small percentage of the rainforest's plants and animals have been studied, suggesting that many more species remain to be discovered and examined.<br><br>(3) Unfortunately, the Amazon faces numerous threats. Deforestation is perhaps the most serious problem, with large areas being cleared for farming, cattle ranching, and logging. Climate change is also affecting the rainforest, as rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns disrupt the delicate balance of this ecosystem. Scientists and environmental organizations are working to investigate these issues and find solutions to protect this precious natural resource.<br><br>(4) The Amazon Rainforest plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate. The trees absorb carbon dioxide, helping to reduce the effects of climate change. The forest also influences rainfall patterns across South America and beyond. When parts of the forest are destroyed, these important functions are compromised. Experts argue that protecting the Amazon is essential not just for the plants and animals that live there, but for the entire planet.<br><br>(5) Many indigenous communities have lived in the Amazon for thousands of years, developing sustainable ways to use the forest's resources. These communities have accumulated valuable knowledge about medicinal plants, sustainable hunting and fishing practices, and forest management. By working with these communities and learning from their traditional practices, we can develop better approaches to conservation. International cooperation and strong environmental policies are needed to ensure that this magnificent natural wonder is preserved for future generations to explore and appreciate.",
