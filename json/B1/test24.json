  "passage": "<br>(1) Genetics is the scientific study of how traits are passed from parents to offspring through genes, which are the basic units of heredity. These genes are found on chromosomes, thread-like structures made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) that contain all the information needed to build and maintain an organism. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, with one set inherited from each parent, giving us a total of 46 chromosomes in most cells of our body.<br><br>(2) The way traits are inherited follows specific patterns discovered by Gregor Mendel, often called the \"father of genetics.\" Through his experiments with pea plants in the 1860s, Mendel identified that traits can be dominant or recessive. Dominant traits, represented by capital letters (like 'A'), will always be expressed if present, while recessive traits, represented by lowercase letters (like 'a'), will only be expressed if two copies are present. This explains why children sometimes have traits that don't appear in either parent but might be seen in grandparents or other relatives.<br><br>(3) Some traits are determined by a single gene, such as earlobe attachment or the ability to roll your tongue. However, most human characteristics, including height, skin color, and intelligence, are influenced by multiple genes working together, which is called polygenic inheritance. Environmental factors also play an important role in how genes are expressed, which is why identical twins with the same genetic makeup can develop different characteristics over time if raised in different environments.<br><br>(4) Genetic disorders occur when there is an abnormality in an individual's genetic material. These disorders can be inherited from parents, such as cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia, which require both parents to pass on a recessive gene. Other disorders, like Down syndrome, result from chromosomal abnormalities that usually happen spontaneously during cell division rather than being inherited. Advances in genetic testing now allow doctors to identify many genetic disorders before birth or early in life.<br><br>(5) The field of genetics has expanded dramatically in recent decades, especially after the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, which mapped all the genes in human DNA. This has led to breakthroughs in personalized medicine, where treatments can be tailored to an individual's genetic makeup. Scientists are also exploring gene therapy, which involves replacing defective genes to treat or prevent disease, and genetic engineering, which can modify an organism's DNA to produce desired traits. These advancements raise important ethical questions about how far we should go in manipulating the genetic code that makes us who we are.",
