  "passage": "<br>(1) Coral reefs are often called the \"rainforests of the sea\" because they are home to approximately 25% of all marine species. These vibrant underwater ecosystems are formed by colonies of tiny animals called coral polyps that secrete calcium carbonate to build protective structures. Found in warm, shallow waters around the world, coral reefs cover less than 1% of the ocean floor but support an incredible diversity of marine life. They provide essential habitats for thousands of species of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other sea creatures.<br><br>(2) For marine animals, coral reefs serve multiple important functions. First, they offer shelter and protection from predators. The complex three-dimensional structure of coral reefs, with numerous cracks, crevices, and caves, creates perfect hiding places for smaller fish and invertebrates. Second, coral reefs are vital feeding grounds. Many fish species directly feed on coral polyps, while others eat the algae that grow on and around the reef. The reef also attracts larger predatory fish that come to hunt the smaller species, creating a complete and balanced food web.<br><br>(3) Coral reefs also play a crucial role in the reproductive cycles of many marine species. They act as nursery grounds where young fish can develop in relative safety. Scientific studies suggest that some fish species can only reproduce successfully in the specific environments provided by healthy coral reefs. Without these protected spaces, the populations of many marine species would likely decline dramatically, potentially leading to local or even global extinctions of certain species.<br><br>(4) Unfortunately, coral reefs face numerous threats today. Rising sea temperatures due to climate change cause coral bleaching, a process where corals expel the algae living in their tissues, turning white and often leading to their death. Ocean acidification, pollution, overfishing, and destructive fishing practices also contribute to reef destruction. Scientists estimate that about 50% of the world's coral reefs have already been lost or severely damaged, and without significant intervention, we may lose up to 90% by 2050.<br><br>(5) Protecting coral reefs is essential not only for marine biodiversity but also for human communities worldwide. Healthy reefs support fishing industries that feed millions of people and provide livelihoods for coastal communities. They also generate billions of dollars through tourism and protect shorelines from storms and erosion. Conservation efforts include establishing marine protected areas, reducing carbon emissions, promoting sustainable fishing practices, and developing coral restoration projects. By taking action to preserve these underwater wonders, we can help ensure the survival of countless marine species and maintain the health of our oceans for future generations.",
