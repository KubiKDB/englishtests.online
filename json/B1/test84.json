  "passage": "<br>(1) Energy is a crucial resource that powers our daily lives in countless ways. There are several different types of energy, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Energy can be broadly classified into renewable and non-renewable sources, depending on whether they can be naturally replenished within a human lifetime. Understanding these different forms of energy and their uses is partial to making informed decisions about our energy consumption and its impact on the environment.<br><br>(2) Non-renewable energy sources include fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. These resources formed over millions of years from the remains of plants and animals and cannot be replaced once they are used up. Fossil fuels currently provide about 80% of the world's energy needs. They are burned to generate electricity, power vehicles, and heat buildings. Nuclear energy is another non-renewable source that produces electricity through nuclear fission, where atoms are split to release energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>(3) Renewable energy comes from natural sources that replenish themselves over short periods. Solar energy harnesses the power of sunlight using panels that convert it into electricity or heat. Wind energy captures the kinetic energy of moving air through turbines. Hydroelectric power generates electricity by using the force of flowing water. Geothermal energy taps into the internal heat of the Earth, while biomass energy comes from burning organic materials like wood, crops, and waste. These clean energy sources produce little to no pollution and help reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.<br><br>(4) Energy storage and distribution are important aspects of our energy systems. Batteries store energy for later use, while power grids distribute electricity across vast distances to homes and businesses. As technology advances, we continue to develop more efficient ways to store and transmit energy. Smart grids, for instance, use digital technology to monitor and manage electricity flow, improving reliability and reducing waste. Meanwhile, researchers are working to improve battery technology to store renewable energy more effectively.<br><br>(5) The future of energy will likely involve a mix of different sources, with renewable energy playing an increasingly important role. Many countries have set ambitious targets to increase their use of renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions. Individuals can also make a difference by choosing energy-efficient appliances, improving home insulation, or even installing solar panels. As we move forward, the transition to cleaner energy sources will be essential for addressing climate change and creating a sustainable energy future for generations to come.",
