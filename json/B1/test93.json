  "passage": "<br>(1) Earthquakes are natural events that occur when there is a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, creating seismic waves. Most earthquakes happen along fault lines, which are cracks in the Earth's surface where tectonic plates meet and move against each other. These tectonic plates are large sections of the Earth's crust that float on the semi-liquid layer beneath them. When these plates move, they can either slide past each other, collide, or pull apart, creating tension that builds up over time.<br><br>(2) The point where an earthquake originates beneath the Earth's surface is called the hypocenter, while the location directly above it on the surface is known as the epicenter. The energy released during an earthquake travels in waves, much like ripples on a pond when a stone is thrown into it. There are several types of seismic waves, including primary waves (P-waves), which are compression waves that move quickly through the Earth, and secondary waves (S-waves), which travel more slowly and cause more violent shaking.<br><br>(3) Scientists measure earthquakes using instruments called seismographs, which detect and record the movement of the ground during seismic events. The traditional seismograph consists of a heavy weight suspended from a frame; when the earth shakes, the frame moves while the weight tends to stay still due to inertia. Modern digital seismographs use electronic sensors to detect ground motion with greater precision. These instruments allow scientists to determine both the location and strength of earthquakes.<br><br>(4) The magnitude of an earthquake is commonly measured using the Richter scale, developed by Charles Richter in 1935, or the more modern moment magnitude scale, which has largely replaced it for measuring larger earthquakes. Both scales are logarithmic, meaning that each whole number increase represents a tenfold increase in the amplitude of the waves and approximately 31.6 times more energy released. For example, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake releases about 31.6 times more energy than a magnitude 6.0 earthquake and about 1,000 times more energy than a magnitude 5.0 earthquake.<br><br>(5) Another important measurement is the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale, which describes the effects of an earthquake on people, structures, and the natural environment. Unlike magnitude scales, which measure the energy released, the intensity scale measures the damage and human impact of an earthquake, ranging from I (not felt) to XII (total destruction). This scale is particularly useful for assessing earthquakes that occurred before modern seismic instruments were available, as historical accounts of damage can be used to estimate intensity. Today, scientists combine data from various measurement systems to develop a complete understanding of earthquakes and their impacts.",
