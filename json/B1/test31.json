  "passage": "<br>(1) Earth experiences four distinct seasons throughout the year due to its tilted axis as it orbits around the sun. This tilt, which is approximately 23.5 degrees, means that different parts of our planet receive varying amounts of sunlight at different times of the year. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it experiences summer, while the Southern Hemisphere simultaneously experiences winter.<br><br>(2) Spring marks the transition from winter to summer and is characterized by warming temperatures and renewed plant growth. As the days grow longer, frozen ground thaws, and dormant plants begin to bloom. Many animals emerge from hibernation during this time, while migratory birds return from their winter habitats. Spring also brings more rainfall in many regions, which helps facilitate the growth of new vegetation.<br><br>(3) Summer arrives when a hemisphere is tilted most directly toward the sun, resulting in longer days and shorter nights. This season typically brings the highest temperatures of the year, causing many plants to flourish and produce fruits. Bodies of water become warmer, and many animals become more active during this period. People often engage in outdoor activities during summer months, taking advantage of the warmer weather and extended daylight hours.<br><br>(4) As summer transitions to autumn, the days gradually become shorter and temperatures begin to cool. Many deciduous trees display vibrant colors as their leaves change from green to yellow, orange, and red before eventually falling to the ground. This process occurs because trees stop producing chlorophyll as daylight decreases. Autumn is also harvest time in many agricultural regions, when crops reach maturity and are gathered.<br><br>(5) Winter occurs when a hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, resulting in shorter days and longer nights. This season is characterized by colder temperatures, and in many regions, precipitation falls as snow rather than rain. Lakes and rivers may freeze over, and many plants become dormant. Some animals hibernate during winter months, while others grow thicker coats or migrate to warmer climates. Despite the challenging conditions, winter landscapes can be strikingly beautiful, with snow-covered scenery creating a peaceful atmosphere.",
