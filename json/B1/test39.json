Located on the eastern coast of Japan's main island, Tokyo combines ancient traditions with ultramodern lifestyles, creating a unique cultural landscape.<br><br>(2) Another massive urban center is Delhi, India, which has grown rapidly in recent decades to become the second largest city globally. With approximately 32 million inhabitants, Delhi faces significant challenges related to infrastructure, pollution, and housing. Despite these issues, the city continues to attract migrants from rural areas who come seeking better economic opportunities and improved living conditions.<br><br>(3) In North America, Mexico City stands as one of the largest urban areas in the Western Hemisphere. Built on the site of the ancient Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, this city sits in a valley surrounded by mountains and volcanoes.
