  "passage": "<br>(1) The Cold War, a period of geopolitical tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, came to an end in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This historic shift began with reforms in the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev, who introduced policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring). These reforms weakened the strict control of the Communist Party and allowed for more freedom of expression and economic experimentation within the Soviet system, ultimately contributing to its collapse.<br><br>(2) The fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 became the most powerful symbol of the Cold War's end. For nearly three decades, this concrete barrier had divided East and West Berlin, representing the larger division between communist and capitalist worlds. When East German authorities unexpectedly opened border crossings, jubilant crowds from both sides climbed onto the wall, using hammers and chisels to break off pieces as souvenirs. The images of these celebrations were broadcast globally, marking a visible end to decades of separation.<br><br>(3) The peaceful revolutions that swept across Eastern Europe shortly afterward led to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union's military alliance. By December 1991, the Soviet Union itself had dissolved into fifteen independent states, with Russia emerging as the largest successor state. The end of the Cold War allowed many countries previously under Soviet influence to pursue democratic reforms and market economies. However, this transition was often difficult, leading to economic hardship and political instability in many former communist states.<br><br>(4) Globally, the end of the Cold War transformed international relations. The bipolar world order dominated by two competing superpowers gave way to a period of American dominance. International organizations like the United Nations gained more freedom to act without being paralyzed by U.S.-Soviet rivalry. Meanwhile, NATO expanded eastward, incorporating former Warsaw Pact countries, while the European Union grew in both size and influence. New security challenges emerged, shifting focus from the threat of nuclear conflict between superpowers to concerns about regional conflicts, terrorism, and failed states.<br><br>(5) The economic effects of the Cold War's end were equally significant. Defense spending decreased in many countries as the immediate threat of global conflict receded. Trade barriers fell between former adversaries, and global economic integration accelerated. The spread of capitalism to former communist countries created new markets and investment opportunities, contributing to what would later be called globalization. However, these changes also led to growing economic inequality both within and between nations, creating new challenges that continue to shape international politics today.",
