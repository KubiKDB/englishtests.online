  "passage": "<br>(1) Online shopping has become an integral part of modern life, but its history dates back to the 1970s. The concept began even before the internet was widely available to the public. In 1979, Michael Aldrich demonstrated the first online shopping system by connecting a modified television to a transaction processing computer via telephone line. This primitive system laid the groundwork for the e-commerce revolution that would follow decades later.<br><br>(2) The 1990s marked the true beginning of online shopping as we know it today. The launch of the internet browser Netscape Navigator in 1994 provided a secure way to conduct online transactions. Amazon was founded in 1994 as an online bookstore, and eBay launched in 1995, creating new marketplaces where people could buy and sell goods virtually. These platforms revolutionized retail by connecting buyers and sellers across geographical boundaries.<br><br>(3) The early 2000s saw rapid growth in e-commerce, with more traditional retailers developing online presences. This period also witnessed the rise of online payment systems like PayPal, which made transactions safer and more convenient. Mobile shopping began to emerge as smartphones became more common, allowing consumers to browse and purchase products from anywhere. The convenience of shopping from home, combined with the ability to compare prices easily, attracted millions of new online shoppers.<br><br>(4) Today, online shopping has evolved beyond simple transactions to become a personalized experience. Artificial intelligence analyzes shopping behavior to recommend products tailored to individual preferences. Social media platforms have integrated shopping features, blurring the lines between entertainment and retail. Virtual and augmented reality technologies now allow customers to 'try before they buy,' visualizing how furniture might look in their homes or how clothing might fit without visiting a physical store.<br><br>(5) Despite its convenience, online shopping continues to face challenges. Concerns about data privacy, the environmental impact of delivery services, and the struggle of small businesses to compete with e-commerce giants remain significant issues. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the shift toward online shopping, forcing even reluctant consumers to embrace digital retail. As technology continues to advance, online shopping will likely become even more integrated into our daily lives, further transforming how we discover, evaluate, and purchase products.",
