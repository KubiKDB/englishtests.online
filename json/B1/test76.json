  "passage": "<br>(1) Transportation systems form the backbone of global trade, connecting producers and consumers across vast distances. Throughout history, advancements in transportation technology have directly influenced the scale and scope of trade between regions and nations. From ancient sailing ships to modern container vessels, aircraft, and high-speed trains, the evolution of transportation has continually reduced costs and time required to move goods, ultimately expanding market access for businesses worldwide.<br><br>(2) Maritime shipping remains the dominant mode of international trade transportation, handling approximately 80% of global trade volume. The development of standardized shipping containers in the mid-20th century revolutionized this sector, dramatically reducing loading times and transportation costs. A single large container ship can carry over 20,000 containers, equivalent to the cargo capacity of dozens of freight trains or thousands of trucks, making oceanic transport particularly cost-effective for bulky or heavy goods.<br><br>(3) Land-based transportation, including railways and road networks, serves as critical infrastructure connecting ports, production centers, and consumer markets. Countries with extensive and well-maintained transportation networks typically experience lower internal trade costs and greater economic integration across regions. In developing economies, investments in transportation infrastructure often yield significant economic benefits by reducing isolation of rural communities and allowing farmers and manufacturers to reach previously inaccessible markets.<br><br>(4) Air transportation, while handling only about 1% of global trade by volume, accounts for approximately 35% of world trade by value. This disparity highlights air freight's importance for high-value, time-sensitive, or perishable goods. The speed of air transport enables global supply chains for products requiring rapid delivery, from fresh flowers and seafood to electronic components and fashion items responding to fast-changing consumer trends.<br><br>(5) Digital technologies are increasingly transforming transportation logistics, optimizing route planning, tracking shipments in real-time, and improving coordination between different transportation modes. These innovations reduce delays and inefficiencies in the movement of goods across borders. As trade continues to evolve, transportation systems must adapt to new challenges including environmental concerns, changing trade patterns, and the growing importance of digital commerce, all while maintaining the critical connection between producers and markets that fuels global economic growth.",
