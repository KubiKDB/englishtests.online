  "passage": "<br>(1) The American Civil War (1861-1865) stands as one of the most significant conflicts in United States history, fundamentally reshaping the nation's political, social, and economic landscape. While many factors contributed to this devastating war, the issues of slavery, states' rights, and economic differences between the North and South were central to the conflict that divided the nation.<br><br>(2) Slavery was perhaps the most divisive issue leading to the Civil War. Northern states had gradually abolished slavery, while the Southern economy remained heavily dependent on slave labor for cotton production. As the nation expanded westward, tensions rose over whether new territories would allow slavery. The Missouri Compromise of 1820, the Compromise of 1850, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 were all attempts to resolve these tensions, but ultimately failed to provide lasting solutions.<br><br>(3) The debate over states' rights also fueled the conflict. Southern states argued that the federal government had no authority to regulate slavery within their borders, viewing such attempts as violations of their sovereignty. When Abraham Lincoln, who opposed the expansion of slavery, was elected president in 1860, seven Southern states seceded from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America. They believed that states had the right to leave the Union if their interests were threatened.<br><br>(4) The war's effects were profound and far-reaching. Most immediately, it resulted in the abolition of slavery through the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865. Additionally, the conflict claimed over 600,000 lives, more than all other American wars combined up to that point. The South's economy and infrastructure were devastated, requiring years of reconstruction, while the North experienced industrial growth and economic expansion.<br><br>(5) Perhaps most significantly, the Civil War permanently altered the relationship between the federal government and the states. The Union victory established that states could not secede, strengthening federal authority over the states. The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments expanded civil rights protections and granted voting rights to former slaves, though full equality would not be realized for another century. These constitutional changes laid the groundwork for the modern American government and continue to shape legal and political debates today.",
