  "passage": "<br>(1) Water is essential for all life on Earth, and the water cycle is the continuous movement of water within the Earth and atmosphere. Also known as the hydrologic cycle, this process ensures that water is constantly being recycled and redistributed around our planet. Without this cycle, freshwater would not be replenished, and life as we know it could not exist. The water cycle has several key stages including evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.<br><br>(2) The cycle begins with evaporation, where the sun's heat causes water from oceans, lakes, and rivers to turn into water vapor and rise into the atmosphere. Plants also release water vapor through a process called transpiration. Together, these processes account for approximately 90% of the water vapor in our atmosphere. As water vapor rises, it cools and forms tiny water droplets around dust particles in the air, creating clouds through the process of condensation.<br><br>(3) When these water droplets become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. This precipitation can fall directly into bodies of water or onto land. Water that falls on land may flow over the surface as runoff, eventually making its way to streams, rivers, and ultimately back to the oceans. Some water also seeps into the ground through infiltration, becoming groundwater that can remain stored in underground aquifers for long periods.<br><br>(4) The final stage of the water cycle is collection, where water gathers in various reservoirs such as oceans, lakes, rivers, and groundwater. Oceans hold about 97% of Earth's water, while the remaining 3% is freshwater found in glaciers, lakes, rivers, groundwater, and the atmosphere. From these collection points, the cycle begins again as water evaporates back into the atmosphere.<br><br>(5) The water cycle plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate and supporting ecosystems. It helps distribute heat around the planet, influences weather patterns, and provides the freshwater necessary for both human societies and natural habitats. Climate change is affecting the water cycle through rising temperatures, which increase evaporation rates and can lead to more extreme weather events like floods and droughts. Understanding and protecting the water cycle is therefore vital for managing water resources and ensuring their availability for future generations.",
