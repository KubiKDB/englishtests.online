  "passage": "<br>(1) The development of writing systems marks one of humanity's greatest achievements. Ancient civilizations created different methods of recording information that eventually evolved into the writing systems we use today. The earliest forms of writing appeared around 3500 BCE in Mesopotamia, which is now modern-day Iraq. These early writing systems began as simple pictographs representing physical objects but gradually became more complex.<br><br>(2) In ancient Egypt, hieroglyphics emerged as a writing system that used pictures to represent words and sounds. The Egyptians wrote on papyrus, a material made from reeds that grew along the Nile River. Unlike the Mesopotamian system, which was primarily used for record-keeping, Egyptian hieroglyphics served religious purposes and recorded the achievements of pharaohs. The Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, finally helped scholars decode these mysterious symbols.<br><br>(3) In China, writing developed independently around 1600 BCE during the Shang Dynasty. Chinese characters began as pictures but evolved into standardized symbols. Unlike alphabetic systems, each Chinese character represents a word or concept rather than a sound. This logographic system remains in use today, making it one of the oldest continuously used writing systems in the world. The invention of paper in China around 105 CE greatly expanded the use of writing.<br><br>(4) Meanwhile, in Mesoamerica, the Mayans developed their own writing system around 300 BCE. Mayan glyphs combined pictographic and phonetic elements and were carved into stone monuments or painted on pottery and bark paper. These writings recorded important historical events, astronomical observations, and religious beliefs. Unfortunately, many Mayan texts were destroyed during the Spanish conquest.<br><br>(5) The Phoenician alphabet, developed around 1200 BCE, became the foundation for many modern writing systems. This innovation used symbols to represent sounds rather than entire words or concepts. This phonetic approach made writing much simpler to learn. The Phoenician alphabet spread through trade routes and was adapted by the Greeks, who added vowels to the system. The Greek alphabet later influenced the development of Latin script, which is used for English and many other languages today.",
