  "passage": "<br>(1) The solar system, a gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, is a fascinating and complex realm of space. Located in the Orion Arm of the Milky Way galaxy, it formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter.<br><br>(2) The solar system is conventionally divided into several regions. The inner solar system comprises the terrestrial planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. These planets are primarily composed of rock and metal and are relatively dense. Beyond Mars lies the asteroid belt, a circumstellar disc in the Solar System located roughly between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. This region is populated by irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets.<br><br>(3) The outer solar system is home to the gas giants: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These planets are characterized by their large size and low density, composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter and Saturn, often referred to as the 'gas giants,' are significantly larger than Uranus and Neptune, which are sometimes called 'ice giants' due to the higher concentrations of water, ammonia, and methane in their atmospheres.<br><br>(4) Beyond Neptune, the solar system extends into the Kuiper belt and the scattered disc, both populations of small icy bodies that include dwarf planets like Pluto, Eris, and Makemake. The Kuiper Belt is a circumstellar disc in the outer Solar System, extending from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 50 AU from the Sun. Further out is the scattered disc, which is still sparsely populated with icy objects.<br><br>(5) The solar system is not static; it is constantly evolving. Planetary orbits shift slightly over vast timescales, and the Sun itself will eventually exhaust its nuclear fuel, transforming into a red giant and later a white dwarf. Studying the solar system provides crucial insights into planetary formation, the conditions for life, and the dynamic processes that shape our cosmic neighborhood.",
